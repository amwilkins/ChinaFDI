AMC, based in Kansas City, Mo., is owned by several investment firms, including JPMorgan Partners, Apollo Investment Fund and Bain Capital Investors.</p>              <p>The transaction, valued at $2.6 billion, would create the world's largest cinema owner, the companies said in a statement.</p>              <p>The deal, in the works for a year, marks the largest investment to date by a Chinese company in the U.S. entertainment industry. It gives Wanda a foothold in the U.S. movie theater business through what some analysts view as a ""trophy"" acquisition.</p>              <p>Until now, most of the deals were in the other direction, with U.S. studios and film companies expanding their business investments in China. This month, Chinese film distributor Bona Film Group announced it had agreed to sell News Corp. a roughly 20% stake. Walt Disney Co. of Burbank and DreamWorks Animation Studios in Glendale also have recently announced joint ventures in China.</p>              <p>For Wanda, acquiring AMC gives it a pipeline into two of the world's largest theater markets -- and more clout in negotiating with major Hollywood studios eager to expand into the rapidly growing Chinese market.</p>              <p>""This transaction will help make Wanda a truly global cinema owner, with theaters and technology that enhance the moviegoing experience for audiences in the world's two largest markets,"" said Wang Jianlin, Wanda's chairman and president.</p>              <p>As part of the transaction, Wanda said it intends to invest as much as $500 million in AMC.</p>              <p>""As the film and exhibition business continues its global expansion, the time has never been more opportune to welcome the enthusiastic support of our new owners,"" AMC Chief Executive Gerry Lopez said.</p>              <p>Last year, China saw a 30% increase in box-office sales to $2.1 billion. This year it passed Japan as the biggest foreign market for Hollywood films.</p>              <p>The nation is in the midst of a multiplex building boom to provide entertainment to a growing middle class. China's goal is to have at least 25,000 movie screens in the next five years.</p>              <p>Leading much of the multiplex growth is Wanda Cinema Line Corp., with 730 screens in 86 multiplexes in China. Wanda had already announced plans to increase its screen count to about 2,000 by 2015. The parent company, Wanda Group, based in the northeastern city of Dalian, is a major real estate developer, with interests in department stores and hotels.</p>              <p>The AMC acquisition fits China's strategy of forming alliances with American companies to expand its homegrown entertainment industry and extend its global influence, or ""soft power.""</p>              <p>For JPMorgan, Apollo and the other owners, the sale enables them to unload a property they acquired in 2004. The companies have been eager to recoup their investment after several attempts to sell the company or hold an initial public stock offering have failed.</p>              <p>AMC recently shelved plans to raise as much as $450 million to pay down debt, although it has yet to formally withdraw its IPO plans in a regulatory filing, according to sources not authorized to talk about the plans.</p>              <p>Some industry analysts said it's less clear what Wanda gets from the deal. They questioned the strategic value of Wanda owning a large theater chain in North America, given long-term attendance declines.</p>              <p>The number of tickets sold at theaters in the U.S. and Canada fell to 1.28 billion last year, a 4% decline from 2010 and the lowest level since the mid-1990s. Ticket sales and admissions have rebounded this year thanks to a crop of strong movies such as ""The Hunger Games"" and ""The Lorax.""</p>              <p>But other observers predicted Wanda would benefit from buying AMC.</p>              <p>""The guesswork is over. China has really arrived on the global stage on the cinema side,"" said Rance Pow, president of Artisan Gateway, an entertainment consulting firm. ""This will give Wanda a big operating advantage in China as they will now have access to global prices for everything from 3-D glasses to popcorn.""</p>              <p>Although no major U.S. theater chain has expanded into China, RealD Inc. in Beverly Hills has partnered with Beijing SAGA Luxury Cinema Management Co. to equip the Chinese theater chain with 3-D technology. Imax Corp., the Canadian big-screen theater company, formed a joint venture with Wanda to open 75 theaters by 2014.</p>              <p>""Wanda is really committed to investing in the business,"" said Richard Gelfond, chief executive of Imax. ""They are prepared to really upgrade AMC's facilities. I think they are in it for the long term.""</p>              <p>AMC already has forged ties with China's film industry. In an effort to experiment with different types of films, in the fall of 2010 AMC launched a partnership with China Lion, a Los Angeles company that distributes Chinese films to North American theaters.</p>              <p>Hollywood studios have been frustrated by rampant piracy in China and tight restrictions on the number of foreign films it allows into the country each year under a revenue-sharing agreement.</p>              <p>China recently agreed to ease some of the restrictions, allowing in more foreign movies and increasing the amount of revenue studios can collect from box-office ticket sales there.</p>              <p>Wanda has been in the news recently because its chairman, Wang, is reportedly under investigation for ties to disgraced Chongqing Communist Party chief Bo Xilai.</p>              <p>Bo was sacked and accused of corruption, and his wife has been charged with the murder of a British businessman.

Most of the deal making has been Hollywood companies striking business deals in China.</p>              <p>But Wanda's move to buy AMC could turn the traffic in the other direction, setting the stage for a string of similar moves by other Chinese investors looking to diversify and raise their global profile by scooping up blue-chip American entertainment properties. AMC is owned by Apollo Investment Fund, Carlyle Group and other investors who bought the company in 2004.</p>              <p>Some see parallels with the late 1980s and early 1990s, when Japanese companies acquired a number of prized U.S. assets, including Hollywood studios such as MCA-Universal and Columbia Pictures and crown jewels such as New York's Rockefeller Center and California's Pebble Beach golf course.</p>              <p>""More and more Chinese companies are going to try to come in and buy American businesses, just like Japanese companies did in the 1980s,"" said Sean Yu, a Los Angeles-based executive director at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney who advises Chinese investors. ""They want to increase their prestige and their reputation.""</p>              <p>Wanda isn't the first private Chinese company to buy American. Chinese carmaker Geely Holding Group bought Ford Motor Co.'s Volvo subsidiary in 2010 for $1.5 billion. In 2004, Lenovo purchased IBM Corp.'s personal computing unit for $1.25 billion.</p>              <p>""It's all about brand names and status, and AMC is a brand name,"" said Stanley Rosen, professor of political science at USC and an expert on China. ""It gives [Wanda] instant credibility.""</p>              <p>Film historian and author Neal Gabler agreed that the Wanda deal could presage another wave of foreign buying in Hollywood.</p>              <p>""I would be almost certain that as the Chinese economy grows, you will see other incursions made into the American entertainment industry,"" Gabler said. Wanda ""may be the first foray, but I guarantee they are not the only ones licking their chops at these American properties.""</p>              <p>Some analysts have questioned how the deal benefits Wanda, noting that AMC is a highly leveraged theater circuit. Wanda is assuming $1.9 billion in debt to acquire AMC at a time when theater admissions in the U.S. and Canada have been in a long-term decline.</p>              <p>As for the growing Chinese market, Wanda's ownership of AMC may have no effect on the distribution of American movies in China, where the government maintains tight controls on the number of foreign movies it allows into the country.</p>              <p>""I'm kind of scratching my head on it,"" said James Marsh, an entertainment industry analyst at Piper Jaffray &amp; Co. ""I don't see the strategic synergies of the deal. I think this is more of a vanity purchase than anything else.""</p>              <p>By creating the world's largest theater company, however, Wanda could use its size to negotiate favorable terms with major Hollywood studios in the world's two largest film markets.</p>              <p>Wang Jianlin, the billionaire who controls Wanda, told reporters in Beijing on Monday that Wanda would invest as much as $500 million to upgrade operations and reduce debt at the Kansas City, Mo., chain, which has 5,034 screens in 346 multiplex locations in the U.S. and Canada. Wanda will keep AMC's management team in place.</p>              <p>Wanda, based in the northeastern city of Dalian, had 13.6% of China's box-office market share last year -- good for first place even though it ranks seventh in the number of cinemas (86) and fourth in the number of screens (730, including 288 3-D screens), consulting firm Artisan Gateway said.</p>              <p>""In terms of quality, I would say they're one of the highest-end chains,"" Wu Renchu, a Shanghai-based film blogger, said of Wanda.</p>              <p>Wanda entered the cinema business in 2004 when it signed a partnership with Warner Bros. to build dozens of modern multiplexes -- a pioneering deal at the time that sparked China's cinema-building boom.</p>              <p>In 2005, Chinese regulators reduced the share foreign companies could own in cinema ventures. Warner decided to leave shortly after.</p>              <p>Since then, Wanda has evolved into China's largest privately owned company, controlling a vast portfolio of luxury hotels, sports stadiums and shopping plazas.</p>              <p>Wanda did not respond to requests for comment but said on its website that the deal received approval in March from China's National Development and Reform Commission.</p>              <p>In the U.S., the deal will be subject to approval by the Federal Trade Commission. Although it is not required, Wanda also is seeking approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., a federal interagency panel that reviews national security implications of foreign investments in the U.S.</p>              <p>Since the 2008 financial crisis, Beijing has encouraged Chinese firms to acquire under-valued Western assets as part of the nation's years-old ""going out"" development strategy.</p>              <p>Culture, especially film, has been cited as a key component to China's ambition to wield more so-called ""soft power."" The deal for AMC could result in more Chinese movies being screened in the U.S. But Chinese features have done poorly in front of American audiences, in part because of weak distribution.</p>              <p>Feng Pengcheng, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, called the AMC deal impressive.</p>              <p>""This is special because it is going into a cultural industry,"" Feng said. ""This carries more significance because of the huge cultural differences between China"" and the West.</p>              <p>Feng cautioned that it would be years before the strategy could be deemed wise.</p>              <p>""It's just an acquisition,"" Feng said.

Chairman Wang Jianlin dressed from head to toe in traditional Mongolian garb before delivering a speech on corporate responsibility to the Inner Mongolian Federation of Industry and Finance.</p>              <p>Now, Mr. Wang is wooing friends in another exotic territory: Hollywood.</p>              <p>Wanda, a real estate developer and manufacturer that has also invested in karaoke clubs, is poised to become one of the biggest players in the U.S. movie business.</p>              <p>The company said late Sunday that it plans to spend $2.6 billion to buy the second-largest U.S. cinema chain, AMC Entertainment Holdings, a 92-year-old concern with more than 5,000 screens, primarily in the U.S. and Canada.</p>              <p>The deal would create one of the world's largest cinema owners and mark the largest acquisition of a U.S. corporation by a Chinese buyer on record. It also confounded many in the U.S. film business, who could find few synergies between AMC and Wanda, which got into the movie business in 2005 and now runs 86 movie theaters in China, along with production and distribution operations.</p>              <p>The acquisition is a reversal of typical Chinese-American entertainment-business deals, in which U.S. studios have sought access to China's explosive growth and a way to skirt the tight limits the country puts on foreign films.</p>              <p>""This deal caught us by surprise, because we've never seen this kind of emphatic strategic acquisition by a Chinese media company,"" said Standard &amp; Poor's stock analyst Tuna Amobi. ""It has usually been the reverse, where U.S. companies like Disney or News Corp. go to China.""</p>              <p>Started as a commercial real-estate developer, Wanda Group operates 28 luxury hotels and 40 department stores around China, according to the company's website. It has dabbled in manufacturing tires but has mostly stuck to real estate, hotels, tourism, entertainment and retail.</p>              <p>Mr. Wang, Wanda's chairman, said on a webcast announcing the deal that Chinese-made movies would eventually enter the broader U.S. market, but the move would be gradual. He added that Wanda wouldn't use AMC as a vehicle to distribute Chinese movies. Whether the chain shows Chinese movies ""will be decided by AMC management according to U.S. industry rules and market demand,"" he said. ""Wanda won't meddle in it.""</p>              <p>He also said Wanda would look for other deals, targeting big cinema operators in Europe and the U.S.</p>              <p>China-based executives at Wanda didn't return calls seeking additional comment regarding Wanda's strategy.</p>              <p>A corporate predecessor was state-controlled, but Wanda is now privately controlled, though Mr. Wang carefully cultivates his political relationships -- a necessity for a major successful business in China. He is a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Congress, a group that meets once a year in Beijing to advise the National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp lawmaking body.</p>              <p>He has publicly pushed for lower taxes on the business sector and for an easing of China's heavy luxury tax, which is often listed as a reason Chinese do much of their luxury shopping abroad.</p>              <p>Mr. Wang, who is in his late 50s, also tries to cultivate an air of business sophistication at Wanda, telling local media in interviews that he requires his staff to wear suits to work. He also occasionally cites U.S. brands when he speaks, telling a group of Dalian business leaders in 2007 on the importance of branding: ""The Coca-Cola CEO once said that even if Coca-Cola was burnt out overnight, the company can raise tens of billions of dollars for reconstruction by the strength of its brand name."" In interviews, he has also listed Simon Property Group Inc. of the U.S. as a real-estate industry benchmark he compares Wanda with.</p>              <p>Mr. Wang is the sixth-wealthiest person in China, according to the Hurun Report, which estimated his wealth at $7.1 billion last year.</p>              <p>A soccer fan, Mr. Wang has also tried to ride to the rescue of that sport in China. Soccer there has been beset by bribery, match-fixing and poor quality on the field. Last year he agreed to contribute roughly 500 million yuan ($79 million) under a deal with the Chinese Football Association to sponsor league play, set up youth leagues and referee training.</p>              <p>Wanda lists its operational headquarters in Beijing but has extensive ties in its original hometown of Dalian.</p>              <p>By entering the U.S. movie business, Wanda joins an industry that has long blamed China for billions of dollars in lost sales of movie tickets and DVDs. Hollywood has often accused China of abetting piracy -- or at least failing to adequately police DVD bootlegging and online copying.</p>              <p>In buying AMC, Wanda would also see up close the other challenges facing Hollywood, including competition from online diversions and stagnating ticket sales. Unlike the rapidly growing Chinese film industry, which is building new theaters at a blistering pace, the U.S. industry is in flux. Theater attendance and box office grosses are up 18.4% and 15.7%, respectively, so far this year, but the growth follows two years of declines.</p>              <p>U.S. movie attendance fell to 1.3 billion in 2011, a 16-year low, according to Hollywood.com, cutting into theaters' two biggest revenue sources: sales of tickets and concession-stand popcorn and other munchies.</p>              <p>Price increases have offset declines in attendance only so much -- and have risked turning off moviegoers who shelled out an average $7.93 per ticket, and considerably more for 3-D movies or IMAX. Box-office revenue in the U.S. and Canada fell 4% in 2011 to $10.2 billion. China's box-office revenue, meanwhile, climbed 29% to 13.1 billion yuan last year, according to China's State Administration of Radio, Film and Television.</p>              <p>Until now, most Hollywood-China deals have involved American studios trying to break into the Chinese market. DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. in February announced plans to form a joint venture with state-owned investment-management company China Media Capital and Shanghai Media Group Inc., one of China's largest television broadcasters.</p>              <p>Also in February the Chinese government relaxed its limits on foreign films, saying it will now allow a total 34 films from abroad a year, up from 20, so long as the additional films use either large-screen IMAX or 3-D technologies. News Corp., which owns The Wall Street Journal, said last week it would acquire a nearly 20% stake in film distributor Bona Film Group Ltd. to give it a stronger foothold there</p>              <p>AMC is owned by private-equity firms which include CCMP Capital Advisers LLC, Apollo Global Management LLC, Bain Capital LLC, Carlyle Group LP, and Spectrum Equity Investors LP. People familiar with the matter said the sale will bring modest profits to those firms.</p>              <p>The proposed deal needs to be approved by a number of regulatory committees on both sides.

By year-end, he expects to have 13 million square meters.</p>              <p>Mr. Wang also defended his deal announced earlier this week to purchase U.S. movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings, saying that on a per-screen basis the deal makes financial sense.</p>              <p>""It was simply worth it,"" he said from the company's operational headquarters in Beijing. ""If you buy a screen in China, it costs 3 million yuan (about $473,500). If you buy the same screen in the U.S., it's less,"" he said.</p>              <p>The 57-year old puts a new face on China's efforts to use its financial firepower to strike deals abroad. Beijing policy makers have been encouraging China's companies to buy foreign brands and assets as it looks to rise up the value chain and diversify the nation's economy away from its traditional reliance on manufacturing, exports and big-ticket investment projects like highways and real estate projects.</p>              <p>With the AMC purchase from a group of private-equity investors, which still requires regulatory approval, Wanda will own more than 5,000 movie screens mostly in the U.S. and Canada in addition to its 86 movie theaters in China. The deal raised eyebrows in the industry because of an apparent lack of synergies between the U.S. and Chinese operations and falling U.S. movie attendance even as China's box office surges. U.S. movie attendance fell to 1.3 billion in 2011, a 16-year low, according to Hollywood.com</p>              <p>Mr. Wang is investing an additional $500 million in AMC to update the facilities to strengthen the company's competition in the market. He said he would encourage AMC to consider new ideas to bring Americans back to theaters, including adding bars or business-class sections. To rev up consumer awareness, he also will prod AMC to launch major advertising campaigns.</p>              <p>Mr. Wang doesn't expect big profits from this investment within the short term, as updating the theaters will take at least a year. The entire effort to rebuild AMC will take at least three years, Mr. Wang said. ""This is a long-term investment,"" he said, adding ""private equity lacks the long-term vision that we have.""</p>              <p>He said Wanda will take a hands-off approach to managing the company. ""Wanda will only send one executive to the U.S. to work with AMC,"" he said. ""AMC leaders will need to innovate and formulate their plan for improving the market.""</p>              <p>Mr. Wang said he plans to invest further in culture-related businesses, such as movie studios and live entertainment.</p>              <p>A soccer-mad son of a Chinese army officer, Mr. Wang prides himself on his work ethic. He said he arrives at the office at 7 a.m. every day. ""I get up early every day to face the day ahead,"" he said.</p>              <p>Addressing speculation in the local media, Mr. Wang said the company hasn't been impacted by the March ouster of Bo Xilai, a former Chinese Communist Party highflier whose fall suggested divisions in the country's leadership. Though now based in Beijing, Wanda got its start in the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian, where Mr. Bo was mayor from 1993 to 2001.</p>              <p>""Within Wanda we have not been investigated and the business has not faced restrictions,"" Mr. Wang said. He added, ""We of course worked with Bo for years, but we had nothing more than a business relationship.""</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Stefanie Qi contributed to this article.</p>              <p>Credit: By Laurie Burkitt</p>                      "

HNA, one of China's Fortune 500 companies, also has investments in the airline, finance and the retail industries.</p>              <p>The expansion is among the largest business deals to date for RealD in China, and is the latest between major companies in the U.S. and the Asian nation. Hollywood is seeking to capitalize on growth opportunities in China, which surpassed Japan this year as the world's largest foreign market for Hollywood films.</p>              <p>The RealD announcement comes after the landmark deal by China's Dalian Wanda Group to buy AMC Entertainment Inc., the second-largest theater chain in the U.S., in a deal valued at $2.6 billion.</p>              <p>Financial terms of the RealD agreement were not disclosed. RealD typically licenses rather than sells its 3-D projection systems. In the U.S., exhibitors pay a fee of 40 to 50 cents per ticket. In emerging markets such as China, the company charges an undisclosed fixed fee in exchange for supplying equipment.</p>              <p>Companies such as RealD are hoping to take advantage of the rapid growth of China's theater industry, which is in the midst of a construction boom, and recent steps by the country to ease restrictions on the number of foreign movies it allows in the country.</p>              <p>China has traditionally allowed only 20 foreign movies into the country under a revenue-sharing agreement. In February, however, the government agreed to allow an additional 14 movies each year, provided those films are in a 3-D or large format such as Imax. The accord, which settled a long-running trade dispute with the U.S., also increases the amount of revenue foreign studios can receive under the quota to an average of 25% of ticket sales from 13%.</p>              <p>By creating more of an incentive for studios to screen their movies in 3-D, the compromise is expected to be a boon to RealD and its rival, Imax, the Canadian big-screen technology company with a large operation in Santa Monica.</p>              <p>RealD's 3-D cinema system is available on 650 screens in China, with an additional 1,250 screens (including ones from HNA) that are due to be installed. RealD also recently signed agreements with Chinese cinema operators Bona Film Group and Poly Film Investment Co. to add 200 RealD screens.</p>              <p>""HNA's entry into the cinema market is an exciting development for China and one RealD is honored to be part of,"" said Edman Chan, RealD's general manager for cinema in China, Southeast Asia and South Korea.</p>              <p>Founded in 2003, RealD has 20,200 screens in 68 countries, including 11,700 in the U.S. and Canada. Although its business is concentrated in North America, RealD has been expanding rapidly overseas, including in Russia and Latin America.</p>              <p>RealD announced its latest deal in China in a conference call with investors after the markets closed. The company also reported net income of $36.9 million, or 65 cents a share, for its fiscal year ended March 23, contrasted with a loss of $12.3 million, or 29 cents a share, for fiscal 2011.</p>              <p>Revenue for the year was $246.6 million, virtually flat compared with the previous year.</p>              <p>For its fiscal fourth quarter, the company reported earnings of $5.5 million, or 10 cents a share, up from $4.5 million, or 8 cents a share, during the same quarter a year earlier.

""We would like to invest in film production, and we'd like to partner with directors, actors and filmmakers from Hollywood. They need to know the Chinese market is growing very fast, and they should come as early as possible.""</p>              <p>Wang said he was also eyeing hotel and retail investments overseas as part of a plan to further globalize his business.</p>              <p>""By year 2020, our major target is twofold,"" the admirer of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs said. ""The first one is to be top 100 in the world and secondly to be a multinational and to be a world-known company.""</p>              <p>The AMC acquisition would make Wang one of the largest movie exhibitors in the world. But it also raises a host of strategic questions for Wanda, which is buying a company saddled with debt and short of growth prospects in an industry that is decidedly mature.</p>              <p>While both AMC and Wanda are in the business of showing films, Wang and his company got into it through the success of his commercial properties.</p>              <p>""Cinemas in China are more about real estate than the exhibition business,"" Wolf said. ""You have a lot of square footage in these multipurpose developments, and multiplex cinemas turned out to be a good way of driving foot traffic to retail.""</p>              <p>The same can't always be said about AMC properties, which are often located separately from major retail developments.</p>              <p>""We're not expecting high growth like the Chinese market,"" Wang said.</p>              <p>But by investing $500 million into renovation -- ""targeting seats, audio systems and screen systems,"" he said, Wang believes he can drive AMC to expand its revenue 10% or more a year.</p>              <p>""I'm a businessman, and the merger and acquisition of AMC is from a business point of view,"" Wang said. ""Right now, some people may say it's not worthwhile to buy out AMC. However, we believe through our constant investment and renovation of the theaters we can create more profit.""</p>              <p>Wang, a 17-year army veteran from China's central Sichuan province, built his empire from scratch in the 1980s in the then-undeveloped port city of Dalian.</p>              <p>It was there that Wang crossed paths with Bo, the former municipal party chief whose corruption scandal has dominated Chinese politics. Bo is accused of jailing thousands of political opponents. He embarrassed Beijing when his police chief sought political asylum at a U.S. consulate. Bo's wife is accused of murdering a British businessman.</p>              <p>Wang has been dogged by rumors over possible illicit ties to Bo because of his vast holdings in the former party chief's former jurisdiction. Wang denied that he or anyone at Wanda was under investigation.</p>              <p>""I know Mr. Bo Xilai. However, we just maintained a working relationship and do not have a private relationship,"" Wang said. ""We do not bribe, and this is the only enterprise in China that will publicly announce no bribery to government officials.""</p>              <p>A businessman who worked closely with Wang, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Wang curried favors from Bo but largely steered clear of the flashy lifestyle that so many other entrepreneurs enjoyed in the booming seaside town.</p>              <p>""Wang is smart,"" he said. ""He paid lots of attention to his business.""</p>              <p>Wang didn't start building cinemas until 2005, when he formed a short-lived partnership with Warner Bros. Today, Wanda is China's largest movie exhibitor, with 730 screens. (By comparison, AMC has 5,000.) Retail property accounts for 80% of the company's revenue, Wang said.</p>              <p>A fan of kung fu flicks and ""Avatar,"" the most successful movie in China's history, Wang said he would like nothing more than to boost the number of available films to show on China's rapidly expanding network of screens.</p>              <p>""Some people say we're trying to export Chinese films to the United States,"" he said. ""That does not reflect our real thinking. What Chinese films lack is content and concepts, not [distribution] channels. The U.S., especially Hollywood, is so strong for film production.

"9","2012-07-24","Chinese Oil Company Bids $15 Billion for Canadian Producer","1027479243","New York Times","B.1","            >                                        >                          <p>12:37 p.m.  Updated </p>              <p>  China is making its biggest and boldest grab for overseas energy resources yet in a $15 billion deal for a Canadian oil producer.</p>              <p>  A takeover of Nexen by China National Offshore Oil Corporation, the Chinese state-run oil giant known as Cnooc (pronounced SEE-nook), would give China a number of footholds in the Gulf of Mexico, the Canadian oil sands in Alberta, the North Sea and the waters off Nigeria.</p>              <p>  The Nexen deal, announced on Monday, is the latest effort by China to amass the natural resources it needs to stoke its powerful engine of growth. In particular, the country's leadership has been focused on reducing dependence on oil imports, as China consumes some nine million barrels of oil a day, second only to the United States.</p>              <p>  ""From China's point of view, the main issue has been energy security, and it always will be,"" Paul Ting, an independent energy analyst, said.</p>              <p>  And for Nexen, which is based in Calgary, the deal will provide an alternative to a stagnant United States market, where prices for Canadian oil have been weak.</p>              <p>  But the transaction, coming seven years after Cnooc abandoned an $18.5 billion bid for Unocal of the United States in the face of heated political opposition to the deal, will be a huge test of whether regulators are now more willing to accept Chinese ownership of strategic assets. Regulators in Canada, the United States and elsewhere will need to sign off on the acquisition.</p>              <p>  Unease over China's buying spree has lingered since the failed Unocal takeover, dissuading many Chinese companies from bidding for outright control of strategic assets.</p>              <p>  Nearly two years ago, Sinochem, a Chinese chemicals maker, decided against a bid for the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, deciding that it could not ease nationalist concerns in Canada. (Canadian officials also rejected a $38.6 billion bid by BHP Billiton, the British-Australian mining giant.)</p>              <p>  That has not stopped China from striking a number of deals in North America and Europe, though nearly all have been in the form of minority stakes or joint ventures. Since 2005, Cnooc alone has announced eight partnerships with the likes of Chesapeake Energy and MEG Energy.</p>              <p>  And on Monday, one of Cnooc's main rivals, Sinopec, agreed to pay $1.5 billion for 49 percent of the North Sea operations of Talisman Energy, another Canadian oil company.</p>              <p>  The Chinese government has also plunged into areas that few private companies would consider worth the risk at the moment, reaching deals with suppliers in Africa and Venezuela.</p>              <p>  China does not directly ship a majority of the oil from its non-Asian production holdings back to its shores, but uses the oil extracted from those areas to trade with others in the oil markets.</p>              <p>  And, perhaps more important, it has been garnering advanced production technologies to better draw oil and gas from nontraditional areas like deepwater fields and hardened rock formations.</p>              <p>  Some analysts, however, have been skeptical of China's strategy, questioning both the price and quality of some of the country's deals.</p>              <p>  ""It would be a mistake to say it's been a tremendous success,"" Lucian Pugliaresi, the president of the Energy Policy Research Foundation, said.</p>              <p>  Cnooc is paying $27.50 a share for Nexen, 61 percent higher than the Canadian company's closing price on Friday. To some, that is a significant premium for a company described as something of a fixer-upper.</p>              <p>  Created by combining two Canadian units of Occidental Petroleum in 1971, Nexen has long been plagued by drops in its production, profits and share prices. Before the takeover announcement, its shares traded at about 58 percent of their 2008 high. Last year, its profit fell 37 percent, to $697 million, over the previous year.</p>              <p>  Nexen's relationship with Cnooc initially developed because of one of its many problems. The Chinese company last year took over OPTI Canada, Nexen's bankrupt partner in an oil sands joint venture, paying $2.1 billion for its 35 percent holding. That project, at Long Lake, Alberta, has been troubled by production delays and problems.</p>              <p>  Nexen's production has also been harmed by the political instability in Yemen, which has long been one of its main sources of reserves.</p>              <p>  Analysts at Nomura criticized the deal as ""value destructive,"" pointing to the potential difficulties of extracting oil from Nexen's international holdings. ""In our view, Cnooc does not have the operational expertise to turn this around,"" they wrote.</p>              <p>  Still, Cnooc's most immediate challenge will be persuading Canada to approve the takeover under its foreign investment laws, which require any deal to be of ""net benefit"" to Canada.</p>              <p>  Cnooc took pains in its announcement to ease criticism by indicating that it would retain Nexen's management and staff and that it would make Calgary, Alberta, the center of Canada's energy industry, its headquarters for operations in North and Central America.</p>              <p>  And Cnooc noted that it had already invested 2.8 billion Canadian dollars in the country.</p>              <p>  Canadian regulators said on Monday only that they were reviewing the Nexen deal. But while the approval process is handled by regulators, the ultimate decision is political.</p>              <p>  ""This is really a test moment,"" said Paul Evans, the director of Asian Research at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. ""Chinese companies are just getting the sense that doing business in Canada is complicated.""</p>              <p>  Reports about the transaction on the Web sites of Canadian news outlets swiftly attracted an unusually large number of comments - an overwhelming majority of which were negative about the proposal. The opposition New Democratic Party also moved quickly to condemn the deal.</p>              <p>  ""Foreign state-owned companies are buying up Canadian natural resources to pursue their own interests, while the Conservative government just sits on their hands,"" Helene LeBlanc, the party's parliamentary critic on industry issues, said in a statement.</p>              <p>  The government of Stephen Harper, Canada's prime minister, has softened its earlier opposition to Chinese investments in the country. During his early days in office, Mr. Harper repeatedly challenged China's human rights record and occasionally snubbed its officials, to the dismay of many in corporate Canada.</p>              <p>  More recently, however, Mr. Harper has dropped that rhetoric and hailed China as a new market for Canadian energy, particularly oil from the oil sands of Alberta. Nearly all of Canada's oil exports now go to the United States.</p>              <p>  Opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline, which would take oil sands production to the American Gulf Coast, appears to be a factor in Mr. Harper's recent attempts to solicit China as both a customer of and investor in Canada's energy sector.</p>              <p>  Under provisions of Monday's deal, while Nexen cannot actively look for higher bids, it can consider any that other companies make on their own. Cnooc has the right to match any such proposal. If directors of Nexen withdraw their recommendation, the company must pay Cnooc a $425 million breakup fee. But if the deal falls apart because of Chinese regulatory reasons, Cnooc must pay $425 million.</p>              <p>  This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. </p>              <div><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""39""/><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""Photograph""/><div class=""Photograph_content""><p>A China National Offshore Oil Corporation Deepwater Oil Drilling Rig at the Port of Qingdao, in East China's Shandong Province.

Mark Twain clearly didn't know much about the oil business.</p>              <p>Oil majors heading overseas to buy competitors tend to bring out the worst aspects of nationalism -- in the target nation. And Cnooc's $15.1 billion bid for Nexen of Canada, announced Monday, would be the biggest-ever overseas acquisition by a Chinese oil company. Moreover, it is haunted by the ghost of Cnooc's failed bid for U.S. major Unocal, derailed by Washington in 2005. But with Nexen, Cnooc appears to have learned from its mistakes.</p>              <p>Nexen fits with the broad strategy of China's oil majors. It will raise Cnooc's output by 22%. Assets in Canada, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria will allay concerns that Cnooc relies too much on China's aging Bohai Bay and politically contentious sites in the South China Sea.</p>              <p>The question is whether politicians block Cnooc. Besides Unocal in the U.S., memories of BHP Billiton's failed bid for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan remain fresh.</p>              <p>Politics is inherently uncertain, but Cnooc is working to blunt any backlash. With Unocal, it made a hostile bid cutting across Chevron's own designs on the company. U.S. politicians were never likely to support that, especially amid unease about China's rise and peak oil Chevron won that one.</p>              <p>With Nexen, Cnooc is making an agreed-to $27.50 bid at a 61% premium. That is pricey, but comes after a considerable decline in Nexen's share price: was above $26 as recently as March 2011. In any case, Nexen won't stoke nationalist feeling in the way Potash did amid BHP's hostile bid.</p>              <p>Nexen is active in the U.S. More important, though, its reserves are small and it operates almost none of the projects in which it owns a stake. Such low-key positions fit the model of Chinese in U.S. oil and gas, post-Unocal.</p>              <p>Meanwhile, the U.K., home to about half of Nexen's current output, is more amenable to foreign ownership, not least because the mature North Sea needs investment. China's Sinopec announced a North Sea deal with Canada's Talisman Energy also on Monday.</p>              <p>But Canada, whose oil sands account for most of Nexen's 5.6 billion barrels of contingent resources, is the key. Since 2009, Chinese firms have made more than $20 billion of acquisitions in Canada, according Dealogic. Included in that is Cnooc's own $2.1 billion purchase last year of OPTI Canada, Nexen's partner in the key Long Lake oil sands project.</p>              <p>Cnooc is emphasizing its commitment, saying it will list its stock in Toronto, keep Nexen's employees and make Calgary its North American headquarters. The latter could help with the wild card of Albertan politics. Cnooc also has the financial firepower to accelerate development of Nexen's oil-sands and shale-gas prospects, boosting investment and tax revenues in Canada.</p>              <p>This deal also could affect the debate over the Keystone XL pipeline in the U.S. Cnooc will want to sell its Canadian oil and gas output to the highest bidders. The U.S., with its pipeline constraints and gas glut, doesn't fit the bill these days. Cnooc could invest in infrastructure to ship oil and gas to Canada's Pacific coast instead, where they can fetch higher world prices.</p>              <p>Extra supplies targeting Asia would please Beijing. Ottawa, meanwhile, could show its southern neighbor that it isn't entirely beholden to (slow growing) U.S. energy demand and its attendant environmental wrangles. Identifying a common antagonist offers one way for Cnooc to co-opt Canada's politicians.</p>              <p>Subscribe to WSJ:</p>              <p>Credit: By Liam Denning and Tom Orlik</p>                      "

Currently, most of its participation is that of a passive partner with international oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Chevron, Norway's Statoil ASA and BHP Billiton.</p>              <p>But Cnooc executives aim to use those assets as a platform for further deals, according to people familiar with the situation.</p>              <p>Roughly half of its Gulf assets, by value, are located in the so-called Jurassic play -- an emerging trend of deep-water discoveries. Nexen has worked together with Shell. Currently a frontier area, it could be a significant source of production for the central Gulf of Mexico, said Norm Pokutylowicz, a Wood Mackenzie analyst.</p>              <p>""By acquiring Nexen, Cnooc gets a foothold in the Jurassic development, which has a lot of upside potential,"" Mr. Pokutylowicz said.</p>              <p>Another big chunk of Nexen's Gulf assets -- roughly a third of its holdings by value -- lie in the Knotty Head development. Nexen operates its interests there -- meaning it makes the project's big decisions on where to drill and how much oil to pump. It also takes on the lion's share of responsibility if anything goes wrong.</p>              <p>Nexen also is an active explorer in the Gulf, with stakes in over 200 blocks, mostly in the central Gulf of Mexico, which is where most of the Gulf's infrastructure lies.</p>              <p>Cnooc would also get Nexen's operations in the North Sea, which include the Buzzard oil platform. It produced 85,000 barrels of oil a day from the North Sea last year.

The project, a joint venture with France's Total SA, will provide up to 36,000 barrels of oil a day to Nexen.</p>              <p>Nexen also has shale gas properties under development in British Columbia, Colombia and Poland.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Ryan Dezember contributed to this article.</p>              <p>Subscribe to WSJ:</p>              <p><object class=""mstar_link_to_media""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""6""/><param name=""mstar_lm_alignment"" value=""Left""/><param name=""mstar_lm_display_control"" value=""Embed""/><param name=""mstar_lm_pred_equation"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_type"" value=""Illustration""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_id"" value=""1""/></object></p>              <p>Credit: By Angel Gonzalez and Edward Welsch</p>                      "

There is likely to be more shaking to come.</p>              <p>China's other state-controlled oil and natural gas companies will consider their own increasingly ambitious deals amid stagnant energy supplies at home and pressure from Beijing and investors to add to reserves, according to industry watchers. The result could be higher prices industrywide for lucrative producing properties, as sellers hold out for better offers.</p>              <p>""All the majors are looking to acquire, and if someone is out there being a lot more aggressive than you are, it makes people who are trying to sell hold on for a higher price, even if there is no chance the Chinese will buy them,"" said Laban Yu, head of oil and gas research at Jefferies Hong Kong Ltd., a securities and investment-banking firm. By overinvesting, he added, ""China is essentially subsidizing oil for the whole world.""</p>              <p>Should it meet regulatory concerns in a number of countries and close the Nexen deal, Cnooc would win significant resources in Canada, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and offshore western Africa.</p>              <p>China's oil companies might find a push into the U.S. slow going. Cnooc and its domestic rivals have been financial partners, helping pay for expensive drilling campaigns in exchange for a piece of the profits. None of the Chinese firms have crews in the U.S. that are needed to operate large fields. And the memory of the unsuccessful bid for Unocal may deter another run at a U.S.-based energy company.</p>              <p>The Nexen deal reflects Chinese state-controlled energy companies' desire to boost reserves immediately. Many of their major domestic initiatives remain years away. Cnooc's ambitions to drill in the South China Sea are complicated by drilling costs that can reach $100 million per deep-water well, according to analysts, as well as by elevated political tensions over continuing territorial claims to the waters by China, Vietnam, the Philippines and others. China is only in the earliest stages of exploring shale gas, which is trapped in rock formations and is plentiful but difficult to extract.</p>              <p>Cnooc has set a target to expand its oil-and-gas output by between 6% and 10% annually between 2011 and 2015. This means the company would need to produce between 419 million and 486 million barrels of oil and gas a year by 2015, up from 331.8 million barrels in 2011.</p>              <p>""If you completely rely on exploration, there could be a performance gap between Cnooc's maturing oil fields and the resumption of production growth,"" said Gordon Kwan, head of energy research for Mirae Asset Securities in Hong Kong.</p>              <p>A sustained focus on North American acquisitions also comes as Beijing has faced growing pressure from the U.S. and Europe to reduce imports from Iran, traditionally one of its most important suppliers.</p>              <p>The companies have more than China's energy needs in mind. While their strategic direction is guided by Beijing, Chinese oil-company executives also face pressure to increase profits and reserves for investors as well as a Chinese public that sees the companies as national assets. The U.S.-traded shares of Cnooc and its rivals, China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corp. -- known as Sinopec -- and PetroChina, the publicly traded arm of China National Petroleum Corp., are down more than 10% over the past year, in part on growth concerns.</p>              <p>Cnooc's deal for Nexen suggests rising prices for energy-producing properties, though comparisons with past deals can be tricky. The company's $2.1 billion deal last year for Calgary-based Opti Canada Ltd. carried a value of about $11 a barrel in proven reserves, which compares with $17 a barrel for the Nexen deal, excluding debt.</p>              <p>The Chinese companies hope that over the long term they will gain the breadth of western rivals such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP PLC, which have assets around the globe and a presence in broad swaths of the business, from offshore oil production to refineries to cutting-edge sources like shale gas. Though they have broadened their assets through deals and expansions in recent years, Cnooc and rivals Sinopec and CNPC are still more narrowly focused on particular facets of the industry, such as offshore production for Cnooc and refining for Sinopec.</p>              <p>China's overall crude output is stagnating. It rose 0.3% to 203.65 million metric tons or 1.49 billion barrels, in 2011 from a year earlier, according to customs data.

Citing Chinese promises to treat foreign investment more fairly, Mr. Schumer writes, ""I believe approval of the Cnooc-Nexen transaction should be a test of these reciprocal commitments, and that concrete progress must be made by both sides simultaneously.""</p>              <p>""It's about time we played a little hardball,"" Mr. Schumer said in an interview.</p>              <p>Mr. Geithner, as Treasury secretary, oversees the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, which reviews transactions by foreign buyers that could have national security implications for the U.S.</p>              <p>The Cnooc-Nexen deal requires U.S. approval because Nexen has several oil wells and considerable acreage in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>              <p>It isn't clear whether the companies plan to file for a CFIUS review. The U.S. government could also review the transaction on its own because of its security implications. The Treasury Department declined to comment on Thursday. Cnooc and Nexen also declined to comment.</p>              <p>Mr. Schumer's request highlights how U.S.-China trade relations remain a prickly issue, especially during an election year. Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has repeatedly criticized China's trade and currency policies on the campaign trail, and pledged tougher action against Beijing.</p>              <p>President Barack Obama has brought World Trade Organization complaints against China and formed a task force to enforce trade rules.</p>              <p>The U.S. Commerce Department has slapped tariffs on a variety of Chinese products that it alleged were dumped below fair value in the U.S.</p>              <p>However, the political reaction to Cnooc's deal for Nexen has been muted compared with the storm that greeted the Chinese company's 2005 hostile bid for U.S. energy company Unocal, which ultimately failed.</p>              <p>Even Mr. Schumer said he believed the latest deal should be approved, provided his conditions are met.</p>              <p>Other lawmakers who have spoken publicly about the bid have done so not to oppose Chinese investment but to spur changes in U.S. energy policy. Sen. John Hoeven (R., N.D.) said the Cnooc deal was a ""direct result"" of the Obama administration's rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline, which was designed to carry Canadian oil into the U.S. Mr. Hoeven presented energy legislation in the Senate Thursday that would approve the pipeline and open more areas for oil and gas production.</p>              <p>Mr. Schumer has frequently spoken out against China's economic policies, including what he has called its undervalued currency.

If the acquisition of Nexen Inc. passes regulatory hurdles in Washington and Ottawa, it would join more than $50 billion in overseas oil-and-gas deals completed by Chinese companies since 2009, according to data provided by securities firm Jefferies Hong Kong Ltd. That is in addition to tens of billions of dollars in loan-for-oil programs in Venezuela, Brazil, Kazakhstan and elsewhere.</p>              <p>Including Nexen's output, a conservative tally of publicly available data on foreign production for major Chinese oil companies would be in the neighborhood of the total output of Norway, the world's No. 15 crude-oil producer.</p>              <p>In many cases, China's oil producers have targeted struggling and underfunded oil-and-gas operations abroad, helping to support supplies amid tight credit markets and a natural-gas glut in North America. Nexen Chief Executive Marvin Romanow resigned in January amid production-related setbacks around the world, including at the company's Long Lake oil-sands project in Canada.</p>              <p>Analysts said Chinese capital investment has helped put downward pressure on energy prices even as demand from China and other parts of the developing world skyrockets.</p>              <p>""Projects are being developed that wouldn't be if China wasn't in the game,"" said Laban Yu, head of oil-and-gas research at Jefferies.</p>              <p>Mr. Yu cited China Petrochemical Corp.'s recent $2.5 billion investment in five U.S. shale blocks owned by Oklahoma-based Devon Energy Corp. The Chinese company, known as Sinopec, owns just a 33% stake in the blocks but is responsible for funding about 80% of the exploration activity.</p>              <p>In other cases, Chinese capital has helped boost output of existing projects. Sinopec said in May that its Addax Petroleum unit, acquired in 2009 for $7.2 billion, had boosted crude-oil output to 8.4 million metric tons from 6.8 million tons in 2009. At the time of the takeover, Geneva-based Addax's crude output was declining because of low reserves and a lack of drilling rigs, the company said.</p>              <p>Sinopec in 2010 acquired 40% of the Brazilian assets of Spain's Repsol YPF SA for $7.1 billion. The deal provided funding for the Spanish company's oil-and-gas exploration and production off Brazil. Since then, the companies have announced discoveries in the Campos, Espirito Santo and Santos basins off shore.</p>              <p>Chinese investment also has spurred supply in regions where few companies had dared tread. The country has emerged as a competitor in Sudan's oil industry despite conflict there.</p>              <p>The world's oil-supply growth is expected to keep pace with demand next year, the International Energy Agency has said, largely because of new supplies from Canadian oil sands, U.S. shale oil and Brazil's Campos and Santos basins -- all of which China is heavily involved in.</p>              <p>Cnooc and other Chinese oil companies are under government orders to make their operations more international. Beijing is concerned that domestic oil and gas production is stagnating and that initiatives to develop unconventional reserves like shale gas in western China and deep-water reserves in the South China Sea remain years away. The government also hopes to reduce its dependence on the Middle East.</p>              <p>Overseas output has compensated for a domestic lag. Sinopec has said it plans to double its share of oil output from overseas projects to more than 50 million metric tons by 2015 from 22.9 million tons last year. PetroChina Co., the listed arm of China National Petroleum Corp., the country's largest oil and gas producer, has said it would spend $60 billion this decade to boost overseas oil production.</p>              <p>PetroChina, whose combined overseas and domestic crude-oil output surpassed that of Exxon Mobil Corp. last year, has said its overseas oil-and-gas production more than doubled since 2007 to 120.8 million barrels last year. The figures don't include output from politically sensitive countries like Iran and Sudan, where operations are controlled by state-controlled CNPC.</p>              <p>Cnooc's acquisition of Nexen would mark an uptick in Chinese involvement in North America, where China has been relegated mostly to serving as a financial backer to U.S. and international oil companies. Nexen holds sizable assets in the Gulf of Mexico, and a successful acquisition would further open the door for Chinese companies to operate in North American oil and gas fields alongside established energy giants like Exxon Mobil.</p>              <p>Analysts have said that acquiring U.S. assets by way of a third country is a less politically dicey way to make U.S. inroads than buying American companies outright.</p>              <p>""Gaining an operating role in the United States via the acquisition of a Canadian company is a smart approach,"" said Erica Downs, who analyzes Chinese energy policy at the Brookings Institution in Washington.

An Aug. 9 front-page article on battery maker A123 Systems incorrectly described the energy investment as being in a U.K. oil company.</p>              <p>(WSJ August 16, 2012)</p>              <p>Subscribe to WSJ:</p>              <p>A company that two years ago was one of the most promising U.S. innovators in the clean-fuel auto industry was rescued from collapse Wednesday. Its buyer: A Chinese auto-parts company.</p>              <p>Wanxiang Group Corp., one of China's biggest parts makers, offered a $450 million lifeline to A123 Systems Inc. a maker of advanced batteries for electric vehicles that received U.S.-government backing. The deal would put the firm's lithium-ion technology and its U.S.-funded manufacturing plant into the hands of a company that has slowly acquired a passel of auto assets across the Midwest.</p>              <p>Wanxiang's investment, part of a move into clean energy technologies, comes as Chinese firms are shaking up the global oil-and-gas industry with bold deals. Last month, state-owned Cnooc Ltd. offered $15.1 billion for a Canadian energy company, on the same day China Petrochemical Corp. offered to buy a stake in a U.K. oil project owned by a Canadian oil company. Globally, Chinese firms have disclosed more than 1,400 acquisitions since January of 2008, says researcher Dealogic.</p>              <p>Waltham, Mass.-based A123's recent losses and a high-profile battery recall were a sharp reversal for a start-up that attracted big-name investors and a $2.6 billion market value just a few years ago. Its troubles show how hard it has become for the Obama administration to cultivate a U.S. supply base and market for electric-powered cars.</p>              <p>Sales of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids in the U.S. remain a fraction of gasoline-powered vehicles because of their high cost, the lengthy recharging times required and limited availability of public charging stations. Three years ago, the administration set a goal of one million plug-ins on the road by 2015, a number that now seems wildly optimistic.</p>              <p>So far this year, Nissan Motor Co. has sold about 3,500 all-electric cars in the U.S. and General Motors Co. has sold about 10,700 of its battery-powered Volt -- out of a total of eight million vehicles sold. Auto makers and governments have pushed the technology as a way to cut reliance on foreign oil, reduce greenhouse gases and encourage a new industry.</p>              <p>Hoping to kick-start an electric-vehicle battery industry, the U.S. provided $1.26 billion since 2009 to battery makers including Johnson Controls Inc., LG Chem Ltd., and Dow Kokam, a joint venture of Dow Chemical Co. and South Korea's Kokam Co., to set up nine factories in four U.S. states. Most are producing far fewer batteries than originally expected.

The company also had to learn from its mistakes as it figured out how to best conduct a necessary upgrade.</p>              <p>""We were trying to perform heart surgery while running a marathon,"" Mr. Gillon said.</p>              <p>The system it formerly used for monitoring shipping was so complex to code that it took six months and cost $70,000 to bring on a new shipper, Mr. Gillon said.</p>              <p>Since it was so hard to bring on a competing shipper with better prices, Lenovo had little leverage to negotiate better rates.</p>              <p>The new logistics system allows Lenovo to bring on a new shipper in just weeks at a cost of $5,000, giving the company more power to push for lower freight fees.</p>              <p>Such cost-cutting efforts have allowed Lenovo to cut logistics and other nonlabor and materials costs by 50% since the acquisition, according to Mark Stanton, a company spokesman.</p>              <p>When Lenovo took over the business from IBM, only 60% of orders were delivered on time.</p>              <p>An updated management system, which allows employees to see the progress of orders as they go through the factory lines and shipping, has helped that number reach as high as 90%, said Mr. Stanton.</p>              <p>""IBM never invested in the IT for PCs because PCs never made any money,"" said Gillon, who came over from IBM with the sale of the PC unit. ""We had to settle for systems that were made for building mainframes.""</p>              <p>Julie Redard, a spokeswoman for IBM, agreed that the company had not invested heavily in infrastructure for its PC business. ""It wasn't our core competency,"" Ms. Redard said. ""There were others that could have more success with it. That's why we sold it to Lenovo.""</p>              <p>To minimize possible harm to its business, Lenovo began the transition in Canada, a smaller market where missteps would be less disastrous, moving gradually to countries where the cost of failure would be higher.</p>              <p>""The last thing we wanted was to build a brand in the U.S. and have a bad IT transition kill it,"" Mr. Gillon said.</p>              <p>The regional strategy may have protected Lenovo from a grave wound. In late 2007, some customer orders were delayed for weeks after an invoicing system printed information that didn't match the products, causing them to get held up by customs at the U.S.-Canada border. The experience caused Mr. Gillon to slow the transition.</p>              <p>""We were trying to do things too fast and we got ahead of ourselves,"" Mr. Gillon said.

China's Dalian Wanda Group recently purchased AMC Entertainment, the nation's second-largest theater chain.</p>              <p>The offer for Digital Domain, made at an auction in New York on Friday, was subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court. The price is significantly higher than a previously announced bid from private investment firm Searchlight Capital Partners to buy Digital Domain's production studios for $15 million.</p>              <p>""This is a great day for Digital Domain,"" Chief Executive Ed Ulbrich said. ""Our new partners have incredible strength and reach in the global entertainment marketplace. They are powerful strategic partners that understand our business and our clients' business.

Year to date, deal volume globally is down 12% compared with the same period last year.</p>              <p>Companies have pulled the trigger on a number of smaller deals, but transformational deals by big companies still are rare. ""If managers have the ability to wait and see right now, they will wait and see,"" said Jim Woolery, co-head of North America M&amp;A at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. ""We are in an environment of transacting out of necessity rather than opportunity.""</p>              <p>Among the hurdles, bankers and lawyers said: economic turmoil in Europe, a plodding U.S. recovery, and slower growth in economies such as China and Brazil that had been helping offset weakness around the globe. Also adding to the worry: the potential for regulatory changes -- for example, in antitrust policy.</p>              <p>""It is more difficult for boards to get comfortable making very large decisions and very large bets"" said Peter Tague, Citigroup Inc.'s global co-head of mergers and acquisitions.</p>              <p>Bankers and lawyers point to a now-familiar set of factors that should lay the groundwork for deals, including relatively inexpensive financing, calm markets and pressure from activist investors to bolster stock prices.</p>              <p>Those types of dynamics will slowly start to produce deals, but not until next year, said Scott Barshay, head of the corporate department at law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore LLP.</p>              <p>""At the beginning of the year, everybody was holed up in their offices, now there is a lot more in the way of discussions,"" Mr. Barshay said. ""It's still very, very hard to get the deals done. Companies are only willing to buy if they can get exactly the situation they're looking for.""</p>              <p>The deals slowdown spanned all major regions. In the U.S., volume fell 2%, to $215 billion, compared with the year-ago quarter, while in Europe it dropped 20%, to $122 billion. Asia, which had been a source of relative strength in recent years, declined 16%, to $135 billion.</p>              <p>There were bright spots. Oil-and-gas deal making saw a 14% increase in activity compared with the third quarter of 2011, with Chinese state-owned oil company Cnooc Ltd.'s proposed $15.1 billion acquisition of Canadian energy firm Nexen Inc. one standout.</p>              <p>Disclosed merger talks between Airbus parent European Aeronautic Defence &amp; Space Co. and British defense company BAE Systems PLC also gave deal makers some hope. A merger would form the world's largest aerospace-and-defense company, with a combined market value exceeding $40 billion.</p>              <p>Still, the deal faces political and other obstacles and might not be consummated.</p>              <p>Several bankers maintain they expect an uptick of activity, particularly in global deals and by sovereign-wealth funds. ""What's going to trigger that? There's going to have to be a period of stability globally,"" said Antonio Weiss, Lazard's global head of investment banking.</p>              <p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was the top-ranked adviser among banks globally in the first nine months of the year, with $405 billion of deals to its credit, followed by J.P.

The cash portion of the deal represents a 35% premium to Celtic's closing price of C$18.12 in Toronto Tuesday. Including debt considerations, the two companies said the deal was worth C$3.1 billion.</p>              <p>The deal is Exxon's largest since the 2010 purchase of natural-gas-focused XTO Energy for about $26 billion, a transaction that many analysts say was a poorly timed effort to get in on the shale-gas boom. Overproduction of natural gas sent U.S. prices to a decade low earlier this year.</p>              <p>Celtic's production and proved reserves are heavily focused on natural gas versus liquids, note analysts with Raymond James Financial, with about 76% of its reserves in gas. But they are just a tiny fraction of Exxon's estimated daily production of 4.368 million barrels of oil equivalent for 2012, and year-end 2011 proved reserves of 24.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent.</p>              <p>Exxon continues to take a long-term perspective on natural gas, expecting it to be a fuel of choice globally in decades to come.</p>              <p>""This latest deal, similar to XTO in some respects -- albeit on a much smaller scale -- can be thought of as Exxon's attempt to dollar-cost average what, in retrospect, was clearly not an optimally timed deal,"" Raymond James said in its research note.</p>              <p>It is also the latest in a string of big deals by foreign buyers in the Canadian oil patch.</p>              <p>In July, Beijing-controlled Cnooc Ltd. said it agreed to buy Nexen Inc., one of Canada's biggest oil companies, for $15.1 billion.</p>              <p>Exxon's deal isn't likely to attract the same scrutiny since it isn't a state-owned buyer.

"27","2012-10-21","After the Boom In Natural Gas","1113865968","New York Times","BU.1","            >                             </title>            >                          <p>EVELYN, La.</p>              <p>THE crew of workers fought off the blistering Louisiana sun, jerking their wrenches to tighten the fat hoses that would connect their cement trucks to the Chesapeake Energy drill rig -- one of the last two rigs the company is still using to drill for natural gas here in the Haynesville Shale.</p>              <p>At its peak, Chesapeake ran 38 rigs in the region. All told, it has sunk more than 1,200 wells into the Haynesville, a gas-rich vein of dense rock that straddles Louisiana and Texas. Fed by a gold-rush mentality and easy money from Wall Street, Chesapeake and its competitors have done the same in other shale fields from Oklahoma to Pennsylvania.</p>              <p>For most of the country, the result has been cheaper energy. The nation is awash in so much natural gas that electric utilities, which burn the fuel in many generating plants, have curbed rate increases and switched more capacity to gas from coal, a dirtier fossil fuel. </p>              <p>Companies and municipalities are deploying thousands of new gas-powered trucks and buses, curbing noxious diesel fumes and reducing the nation's reliance on imported oil. </p>              <p>And companies like fertilizer and chemical makers, which use gas as a raw material, are suddenly finding that the United States is an attractive place to put new factories, compared with, say, Asia, where gas is four times the price. Dow Chemical, which uses natural gas as a material for producing plastics, has assembled a list of 91 new manufacturing projects, representing $70 billion in potential investment and up to three million jobs, that various companies have proposed or begun because of cheap gas.</p>              <p>""The country has stumbled into a windfall on the backs of these entrepreneurs,"" said Edward Hirs, a finance professor at the University of Houston who contributed to a report that estimated that the nation's economy benefited by more than $100 billion last year alone from the lower gas prices.</p>              <p>But while the gas rush has benefited most Americans, it's been a money loser so far for many of the gas exploration companies and their tens of thousands of investors. </p>              <p>The drillers punched so many holes and extracted so much gas through hydraulic fracturing that they have driven the price of natural gas to near-record lows. And because of the intricate financial deals and leasing arrangements that many of them struck during the boom, they were unable to pull their foot off the accelerator fast enough to avoid a crash in the price of natural gas, which is down more than 60 percent since the summer of 2008. </p>              <p>Although the bankers made a lot of money from the deal making and a handful of energy companies made fortunes by exiting at the market's peak, most of the industry has been bloodied -- forced to sell assets, take huge write-offs and shift as many drill rigs as possible from gas exploration to oil, whose price has held up much better.</p>              <p>Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, which spent $41 billion to buy XTO Energy, a giant natural gas company, in 2010, when gas prices were almost double what they are today, minced no words about the industry's plight during an appearance in New York this summer.</p>              <p>""We are all losing our shirts today,"" Mr. Tillerson said. ""We're making no money. It's all in the red.""</p>              <p>Like the recent credit bubble, the boom and bust in gas were driven in large part by tens of billions of dollars in creative financing engineered by investment banks like Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Jefferies &amp; Company. </p>              <p>After the financial crisis, the natural gas rush was one of the few major profit centers for Wall Street deal makers, who found willing takers among energy companies and foreign financial investors.</p>              <p>Big companies like Chesapeake and lesser-known outfits like Quicksilver Resources and Exco Resources were able to supercharge their growth with the global financing, transforming the face of energy in this country. In all, the top 50 oil and gas companies raised and spent an annual average of $126 billion over the last six years on drilling, land acquisition and other capital costs within the United States, double their capital spending as of 2005, according to an analysis by Ernst &amp; Young.</p>              <p>Now the gas companies are committed to spending far more to produce gas than they can earn selling it. Their stock prices and debt ratings have been hammered. </p>              <p>""We just killed more meat than we could drag back to the cave and eat,"" said Maynard Holt, co-president of Tudor Pickering Holt &amp; Company, a Houston investment bank that has handled dozens of shale deals in the last four years. ""Now we have a problem.""</p>              <p> A Master Salesman</p>              <p>Aubrey K. McClendon, chief executive of Chesapeake Energy, had a secret, and he was anxious to share it. </p>              <p>He called Ralph Eads III, a fraternity buddy from Duke who had become his go-to banker. Mr. McClendon explained that he had quietly acquired leases on hundreds of thousands of acres somewhere in the southern United States -- he would not say exactly where -- that could become one of the world's biggest natural gas fields.</p>              <p>But to develop the wells, he needed billions of dollars.</p>              <p>""I can get the assets,"" Mr. McClendon told Mr. Eads, a vice chairman of Jefferies, according to three people who participated in that call, nearly five years ago. ""You have to get the money."" </p>              <p>Get it he did. Mr. Eads, a pitch artist who projects the unrestrained enthusiasm of a college football coach, traveled the world, ultimately raising an extraordinary $28 billion for Mr. McClendon's ""secret"" venture in the Haynesville Shale, as well as other Chesapeake drilling projects. </p>              <p>Other bankers working in the glass office towers of downtown Houston were equally busy. While the skyscrapers are home to global giants like Chevron and lesser-known companies like Plains Exploration and Production, they also house storefronts for Wall Street deal makers who play a vital, though less visible, role in the nation's surging energy production. </p>              <p>Mr. Eads, 53, a Texas native, is a prince of this world. His financial innovations helped feed the gas drilling boom, and he has participated in $159 billion worth of oil and gas deals since 2007.</p>              <p>A Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity brother of Mr. McClendon, he headed to Wall Street directly after Duke. He first earned a national profile in 2001, while working for the El Paso Corporation, a natural gas pipeline operator. Regulators accused El Paso of creating an artificial gas shortage in California in the previous year, contributing to a power crisis in the state. Although El Paso eventually settled the complaints for $1.7 billion, Mr. Eads said El Paso was guilty of nothing more than coming up with creative financial transactions. </p>              <p>""I wake up every day thinking about how to finance big things,"" he said. </p>              <p>His tall, lanky frame and bellowing voice make him hard to miss, even in a large crowd. And his deal radar is never off, as he works the room at dinner parties and charity events. </p>              <p>That is how he met Jim Flores, the chief executive of Plains Exploration, who eventually invited him on a duck hunt. </p>              <p>After Mr. McClendon's urgent request for money, Mr. Eads put in a call to Mr. Flores to see if he might be willing to finance part of Chesapeake's Haynesville project.</p>              <p>""Aubrey and I have calculated it, and it might be the largest gas field in the world,"" Mr. Eads said he told Mr. Flores, noting early results from a single well that showed unprecedented gas flows. </p>              <p>The type of deal he pitched, nicknamed ""cash and carry,"" was certainly aggressive and innovative. Plains would pay Chesapeake $1.7 billion to gain ownership of about one-third of the drilling rights that Chesapeake had leased in the Haynesville. Plains would also commit to paying out another $1.7 billion to cover half of Chesapeake's drilling costs, in return for part of the future profits.</p>              <p>""It's going to be a great investment,"" Mr. Flores said on the day the deal was announced in July 2008.</p>              <p>But the deal, like others later struck by Chesapeake, benefited Mr. Eads and Mr. McClendon and their companies far more than the people writing the big checks.</p>              <p>Chesapeake spent an average of $7,100 an acre on the drilling sites it had leased in the Haynesville. Plains paid Chesapeake the equivalent of $30,000 an acre. </p>              <p>Jefferies and the other firms involved in arranging the deal made an estimated $23 million on this transaction.</p>              <p>Much of the money that Mr. Eads raised for American gas drillers came from overseas oil and gas companies, like Total of France and Cnooc, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation. He told them the American shale revolution was an opportunity they simply could not afford to pass by.</p>              <p>""This is like owning the Empire State Building,"" Mr. Eads said, recalling one of his favorite lines. ""It's not going to be repeated. You miss the boat, you miss the boat.""</p>              <p>In China, he was in awe at just how much money was available to invest. One senior executive at a major Chinese oil company that Mr. Eads declined to identify, citing the confidential nature of the negotiations, explained that the country wanted to move as much as $750 billion from United States Treasury bonds into the North American energy business.</p>              <p>Mr. Eads was only happy to oblige, helping to secure $3.4 billion  from the Chinese for Chesapeake through two deals.</p>              <p>Not everyone believed the story line of endless profits and opportunity. Mr. Eads said one oil company executive whom he would not identify had rejected his pitch, complaining, ""The reason for the glut is you guys."" The executive said he expected natural gas prices to plummet.</p>              <p>In private, Mr. Eads acknowledged that his pitches involved a bit of bluster.</p>              <p>""Typically, we represent sellers, so I want to persuade buyers that gas prices are going to be as high as possible,"" Mr. Eads said. ""The buyers are big boys -- they are giant companies with thousands of gas economists who know way more than I know. Caveat emptor.""</p>              <p>Investment banking revenue at Jefferies reached $1.1 billion in 2011, a record for the firm, up from $750 million in 2007. Energy deals were cited among the biggest drivers of that surge, which came despite major problems at the firm because of its exposure to European sovereign debt.</p>              <p>Mr. Eads would not say how much he had been compensated for this bonanza. But Dealogic, a firm that tracks Wall Street transactions, estimated that Jefferies collected at least $124 million in fees from Chesapeake since 2007, a large share of its overall revenue on oil and gas deals, which ranged between $390 million and $700 million during the same period, according to two different industry estimates.</p>              <p>Even before the recent round of deals, Mr. Eads was a wealthy man. He lives in a sprawling, 11,000-square-foot lakefront mansion in Houston and has a wine cellar with 6,500 bottles. In 2010, he bought an $8.2 million home in the exclusive West End of Aspen, Colo., whose other homeowners have included Jack Nicholson and Mariah Carey. </p>              <p>Mr. Eads's success has produced no shortage of jealousy in Houston. </p>              <p>""A lot of people don't like him because he got ahead of everyone else,"" said Chip Johnson, chief executive of Carrizo Oil and Gas, who made two big deals in which Mr. Eads was involved. ""He got the reputation for overselling, but I have a hard time believing you can fool the big companies."" </p>              <p>""Without him,"" Mr. Johnson added, ""the country would not have had the huge gas supply as quickly as we did.""</p>              <p>Others have been more critical.</p>              <p>""He is like the bartender serving drinks for people who can't handle it,"" said Fadel Gheit, a managing director at Oppenheimer &amp; Company, about Mr. Eads. ""And the whole gas industry has gotten a rude awakening, a hangover, with gas prices plummeting. The investment bankers were happy to help with a smile and get their cut."" </p>              <p> A Train Without Brakes</p>              <p>""Quit drilling,"" T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman, barked to his fellow board members at Exco Resources, a small, independent drilling company based in Dallas that, like Chesapeake, had made a big bet in the Haynesville. ""Shut her down.""</p>              <p>Mr. Pickens, 84, made billions of dollars as a hedge fund manager and wildcatter drilling for oil and gas. He borrowed heavily to build up the oil and gas reserves of Mesa Inc. in the late 1980s before losing the company during its financial difficulties a decade later, when drooping gas prices hurt its ability to repay debts and pay dividends. He wanted Exco to avoid a similar fate. </p>              <p>There was only one problem: under the contracts that Exco signed, it couldn't stop drilling. </p>              <p>The company followed Chesapeake's lead and struck its own $1.3 billion cash-and-carry deal with the BG Group, a British gas company. BG paid Exco $655 million in cash upfront and agreed to foot 75 percent of the bill for future drilling in the Haynesville in return for a share in future profits on the gas produced.</p>              <p>When the arrangement was made, it seemed like a winner all around. Exco had more than 53,000 acres of leases in the Haynesville, but like Chesapeake, it lacked the money it needed to drill on all the land. BG's financing helped Exco to increase the number of rigs it had working in the Haynesville to 22 from four.</p>              <p>Nevertheless, the agreement, negotiated by Goldman Sachs, came with some important strings attached: Exco had to keep all 22 rigs drilling for gas, even as the price was dropping. BG wanted to reach certain targets for drilling wells and producing gas in the United States, and it was intent on sticking with the plan, even if its partner now insisted that it made no economic sense.</p>              <p>""They are great partners, but they have their pedal down around the world, and we are part of that,"" Douglas H. Miller, Exco's chief executive, explained to Wall Street analysts last year.</p>              <p>Mr. Pickens was furious. ""We are stupid to drill these wells,"" he said in a recent interview. </p>              <p>But Exco was not alone. Many of its fellow gas companies -- including Chesapeake and Petrohawk -- had little choice through last year but to keep drilling, no matter how low the price fell or how big a glut was forming.</p>              <p>It wasn't just the cash-and-carry deals that were forcing them to drill.</p>              <p>The land that the natural gas companies had leased, in most cases, came with ""use it or lose it"" clauses that required them to start drilling within three years and begin paying royalties to the landowners or lose the leases.</p>              <p>Exco, Chesapeake and others initially boasted about how many acres they had managed to lock up. But after paying bonuses of up to $20,000 an acre to the landowners, the companies could not afford to lose the leases, even if the low price of natural gas meant that drilling more wells was a losing proposition.</p>              <p>The industry was also driven to keep drilling because of the perverse way that Wall Street values oil and gas companies. Analysts rate drillers on their so-called proven reserves, an estimate of how much oil and gas they have in the ground. Simply by drilling a single well, they could then count as part of their reserves nearby future well sites. In this case, higher reserves generally led to a higher stock price, even though some of the companies were losing money each quarter and piling up billions of dollars in debt.</p>              <p>Just as in the earlier real estate bubble, the main players publicly predicted success even as, privately, their doubts were growing, court documents show. </p>              <p>Mr. McClendon suggested in August 2008 to Wall Street analysts that he had fundamentally transformed the once-risky, century-old oil and gas business into something with the reliability of an assembly line.</p>              <p>""We consider ourselves to be in the gas manufacturing business, and that requires four inputs in our opinion -- those inputs are land, people, science and, of course, capital,"" Mr. McClendon told the analysts. ""We think that's pretty impressive and hope you do as well.""</p>              <p>But soon after, he told some Chesapeake employees that the company might have made some big mistakes. ""What was a fair price 90 days ago for a lease is now overpriced by a factor of at least 2x given the dramatic worsening of the natural gas and financial markets,"" Mr. McClendon wrote in an October 2008 e-mail that has since become public in a lawsuit against Chesapeake. </p>              <p>And as with so many other shale gas players, Chesapeake struck so many complicated financial deals that it couldn't stop ramping up the gas factory. </p>              <p>""At least half and probably two-thirds or three-quarters of our gas drilling is what I would call involuntary,"" Mr. McClendon acknowledged at one point. </p>              <p>For him, the drilling binge had some significant financial consequences. During the good times, Chesapeake paid him handsomely in cash and perks. He achieved a net worth of over $1 billion, and he made it to the Forbes list of the 400 wealthiest Americans. He bought homes in Bermuda, Colorado and Hawaii, as well as a stake in the Oklahoma City Thunder basketball team.</p>              <p>An unusual company program also allowed Mr. McClendon to buy a small personal stake in Chesapeake's wells. That is expected to reap more than $400 million for him over the 15- to 20-year life of the wells, although it has strained his personal finances for now. An investigation by Reuters detailed how Mr. McClendon had borrowed heavily from Chesapeake business partners to help finance his share of the wells' costs. That and other issues drew the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission, shook investor confidence in him and prompted a shake-up of Chesapeake's board that included the removal of Mr. McClendon as chairman. </p>              <p>(Mr. McClendon refused requests to be interviewed for this article, and he did not respond to a list of questions.)</p>              <p>Mr. Eads appears to have fared better. He had seen the coming crash, and, as any master salesman would, found a way to play both sides. He continued to persuade new investors of the great potential in shale while telling his longtime clients to cash out.</p>              <p>""It is a great time to sell,"" Mr. Eads recalled telling Terry Pegula, the founder of East Resources, who had built up his own operation in the Marcellus region of Pennsylvania from one well to 75 over the course of one year. ""With all these new plays popping up, I had a real concern gas prices would weaken."" </p>              <p>Mr. Eads then helped arrange what will go down as one of the great early paydays of the shale revolution: the 2010 sale of East Resources, which Mr. Pegula had started with $7,500 borrowed from family and friends, to Royal Dutch Shell for $4.7 billion. </p>              <p>There were a handful of other such profit takers, including the Houston businessman Floyd Wilson, who created a company in 2003 called Petrohawk Energy with the intention from the start of selling it. Petrohawk drilled its first Haynesville well in 2008. Last year, it sold itself to an Australian energy conglomerate, BHP Billiton, in a $15 billion deal that brought Mr. Wilson and other executives a payout worth at least $304 million. </p>              <p>But for many gas drillers, there has been only pain.</p>              <p>Exco, whose production of natural gas was still rising in the Haynesville as of early this year, saw its credit rating downgraded in May. It reported a loss of nearly $780 million for the first half of the year, before write-offs and other adjustments, even after it reduced its work force and rig count. BG, its joint venture partner, reported in July that it was taking a $1.3 billion write-down on its shale gas investments in the United States, including the Haynesville deal with Exco.</p>              <p>Plains Exploration, which celebrated its first deal with Chesapeake back in 2008, reported a loss for the first quarter this year, but has since shifted heavily away from gas to oil production and is making money again. Warm weather last winter exacerbated the glut to historic levels, reducing prices even further, since so little gas was needed to heat homes in many parts of the nation.</p>              <p>Chesapeake's stock price sank this year after it was revealed that Mr. McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and then used those investments as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans used mostly to pay for his share of the cost of drilling those wells. The company is trying to raise $14 billion this year by shedding assets, a goal it has almost reached with huge recent sales of West Texas oil and gas fields and pipelines to Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron.</p>              <p>To help the company through this difficult patch, Mr. McClendon turned to his old friend, Mr. Eads. Jefferies &amp; Company, joined by Goldman Sachs, offered Chesapeake an emergency $4 billion unsecured bridge loan, at 8.5 percent interest, to give the company a lifeline until it could sell enough assets to keep afloat. (The company says it intends to pay back the entire loan this year from recent sales.) </p>              <p>In hindsight, it should have been clear to everyone that a bust was likely to occur, with so many new wells being drilled and so much money financing them. </p>              <p>But everyone was too busy working out new deals to pay much heed.</p>              <p>The bust has certainly hit the Haynesville hard. Some local landowners, having spent their initial lease bonuses, are now deeply in debt. Local restaurants and other businesses are suffering steep losses now that so many drillers have left town.</p>              <p>""At this point we're struggling,"" said Shelby Spurlock, co-owner of Cafe 171 in the town of Mansfield. The restaurant is decorated with wall collages of drill worker uniforms from companies that are leaving the area. Once open from 4 a.m. to 10 p.m. and employing four servers, the restaurant has cut its hours and is down to two servers. ""Our very existence is in danger,"" she sighed. </p>              <p>Mr. Eads, ever the deal maker, is unfazed. He tells anyone who will listen that the price of natural gas will eventually recover. He is making money, meanwhile, helping struggling companies and opportunistic investors strike deals at the new, lower prices. </p>              <p>""These shale assets are forever,"" he said. ""They are going to produce for a hundred years."" </p>              <p>The Energy Rush: Articles in this series are examining the transformation of energy production in the United States.

"29","2012-10-21","After the Boom In Natural Gas","1115302473","New York Times","BU.1","            >                             </title>            >                          <p>EVELYN, La.</p>              <p>THE crew of workers fought off the blistering Louisiana sun, jerking their wrenches to tighten the fat hoses that would connect their cement trucks to the Chesapeake Energy drill rig -- one of the last two rigs the company is still using to drill for natural gas here in the Haynesville Shale.</p>              <p>At its peak, Chesapeake ran 38 rigs in the region. All told, it has sunk more than 1,200 wells into the Haynesville, a gas-rich vein of dense rock that straddles Louisiana and Texas. Fed by a gold-rush mentality and easy money from Wall Street, Chesapeake and its competitors have done the same in other shale fields from Oklahoma to Pennsylvania.</p>              <p>For most of the country, the result has been cheaper energy. The nation is awash in so much natural gas that electric utilities, which burn the fuel in many generating plants, have curbed rate increases and switched more capacity to gas from coal, a dirtier fossil fuel. </p>              <p>Companies and municipalities are deploying thousands of new gas-powered trucks and buses, curbing noxious diesel fumes and reducing the nation's reliance on imported oil. </p>              <p>And companies like fertilizer and chemical makers, which use gas as a raw material, are suddenly finding that the United States is an attractive place to put new factories, compared with, say, Asia, where gas is four times the price. Dow Chemical, which uses natural gas as a material for producing plastics, has assembled a list of 91 new manufacturing projects, representing $70 billion in potential investment and up to three million jobs, that various companies have proposed or begun because of cheap gas.</p>              <p>""The country has stumbled into a windfall on the backs of these entrepreneurs,"" said Edward Hirs, a finance professor at the University of Houston who contributed to a report that estimated that the nation's economy benefited by more than $100 billion last year alone from the lower gas prices.</p>              <p>But while the gas rush has benefited most Americans, it's been a money loser so far for many of the gas exploration companies and their tens of thousands of investors. </p>              <p>The drillers punched so many holes and extracted so much gas through hydraulic fracturing that they have driven the price of natural gas to near-record lows. And because of the intricate financial deals and leasing arrangements that many of them struck during the boom, they were unable to pull their foot off the accelerator fast enough to avoid a crash in the price of natural gas, which is down more than 60 percent since the summer of 2008. </p>              <p>Although the bankers made a lot of money from the deal making and a handful of energy companies made fortunes by exiting at the market's peak, most of the industry has been bloodied -- forced to sell assets, take huge write-offs and shift as many drill rigs as possible from gas exploration to oil, whose price has held up much better.</p>              <p>Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, which spent $41 billion to buy XTO Energy, a giant natural gas company, in 2010, when gas prices were almost double what they are today, minced no words about the industry's plight during an appearance in New York this summer.</p>              <p>""We are all losing our shirts today,"" Mr. Tillerson said. ""We're making no money. It's all in the red.""</p>              <p>Like the recent credit bubble, the boom and bust in gas were driven in large part by tens of billions of dollars in creative financing engineered by investment banks like Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Jefferies &amp; Company. </p>              <p>After the financial crisis, the natural gas rush was one of the few major profit centers for Wall Street deal makers, who found willing takers among energy companies and foreign financial investors.</p>              <p>Big companies like Chesapeake and lesser-known outfits like Quicksilver Resources and Exco Resources were able to supercharge their growth with the global financing, transforming the face of energy in this country. In all, the top 50 oil and gas companies raised and spent an annual average of $126 billion over the last six years on drilling, land acquisition and other capital costs within the United States, double their capital spending as of 2005, according to an analysis by Ernst &amp; Young.</p>              <p>Now the gas companies are committed to spending far more to produce gas than they can earn selling it. Their stock prices and debt ratings have been hammered. </p>              <p>""We just killed more meat than we could drag back to the cave and eat,"" said Maynard Holt, co-president of Tudor Pickering Holt &amp; Company, a Houston investment bank that has handled dozens of shale deals in the last four years. ""Now we have a problem.""</p>              <p> A Master Salesman</p>              <p>Aubrey K. McClendon, chief executive of Chesapeake Energy, had a secret, and he was anxious to share it. </p>              <p>He called Ralph Eads III, a fraternity buddy from Duke who had become his go-to banker. Mr. McClendon explained that he had quietly acquired leases on hundreds of thousands of acres somewhere in the southern United States -- he would not say exactly where -- that could become one of the world's biggest natural gas fields.</p>              <p>But to develop the wells, he needed billions of dollars.</p>              <p>""I can get the assets,"" Mr. McClendon told Mr. Eads, a vice chairman of Jefferies, according to three people who participated in that call, nearly five years ago. ""You have to get the money."" </p>              <p>Get it he did. Mr. Eads, a pitch artist who projects the unrestrained enthusiasm of a college football coach, traveled the world, ultimately raising an extraordinary $28 billion for Mr. McClendon's ""secret"" venture in the Haynesville Shale, as well as other Chesapeake drilling projects. </p>              <p>Other bankers working in the glass office towers of downtown Houston were equally busy. While the skyscrapers are home to global giants like Chevron and lesser-known companies like Plains Exploration and Production, they also house storefronts for Wall Street deal makers who play a vital, though less visible, role in the nation's surging energy production. </p>              <p>Mr. Eads, 53, a Texas native, is a prince of this world. His financial innovations helped feed the gas drilling boom, and he has participated in $159 billion worth of oil and gas deals since 2007.</p>              <p>A Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity brother of Mr. McClendon, he headed to Wall Street directly after Duke. He first earned a national profile in 2001, while working for the El Paso Corporation, a natural gas pipeline operator. Regulators accused El Paso of creating an artificial gas shortage in California in the previous year, contributing to a power crisis in the state. Although El Paso eventually settled the complaints for $1.7 billion, Mr. Eads said El Paso was guilty of nothing more than coming up with creative financial transactions. </p>              <p>""I wake up every day thinking about how to finance big things,"" he said. </p>              <p>His tall, lanky frame and bellowing voice make him hard to miss, even in a large crowd. And his deal radar is never off, as he works the room at dinner parties and charity events. </p>              <p>That is how he met Jim Flores, the chief executive of Plains Exploration, who eventually invited him on a duck hunt. </p>              <p>After Mr. McClendon's urgent request for money, Mr. Eads put in a call to Mr. Flores to see if he might be willing to finance part of Chesapeake's Haynesville project.</p>              <p>""Aubrey and I have calculated it, and it might be the largest gas field in the world,"" Mr. Eads said he told Mr. Flores, noting early results from a single well that showed unprecedented gas flows. </p>              <p>The type of deal he pitched, nicknamed ""cash and carry,"" was certainly aggressive and innovative. Plains would pay Chesapeake $1.7 billion to gain ownership of about one-third of the drilling rights that Chesapeake had leased in the Haynesville. Plains would also commit to paying out another $1.7 billion to cover half of Chesapeake's drilling costs, in return for part of the future profits.</p>              <p>""It's going to be a great investment,"" Mr. Flores said on the day the deal was announced in July 2008.</p>              <p>But the deal, like others later struck by Chesapeake, benefited Mr. Eads and Mr. McClendon and their companies far more than the people writing the big checks.</p>              <p>Chesapeake spent an average of $7,100 an acre on the drilling sites it had leased in the Haynesville. Plains paid Chesapeake the equivalent of $30,000 an acre. </p>              <p>Jefferies and the other firms involved in arranging the deal made an estimated $23 million on this transaction.</p>              <p>Much of the money that Mr. Eads raised for American gas drillers came from overseas oil and gas companies, like Total of France and Cnooc, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation. He told them the American shale revolution was an opportunity they simply could not afford to pass by.</p>              <p>""This is like owning the Empire State Building,"" Mr. Eads said, recalling one of his favorite lines. ""It's not going to be repeated. You miss the boat, you miss the boat.""</p>              <p>In China, he was in awe at just how much money was available to invest. One senior executive at a major Chinese oil company that Mr. Eads declined to identify, citing the confidential nature of the negotiations, explained that the country wanted to move as much as $750 billion from United States Treasury bonds into the North American energy business.</p>              <p>Mr. Eads was only happy to oblige, helping to secure $3.4 billion  from the Chinese for Chesapeake through two deals.</p>              <p>Not everyone believed the story line of endless profits and opportunity. Mr. Eads said one oil company executive whom he would not identify had rejected his pitch, complaining, ""The reason for the glut is you guys."" The executive said he expected natural gas prices to plummet.</p>              <p>In private, Mr. Eads acknowledged that his pitches involved a bit of bluster.</p>              <p>""Typically, we represent sellers, so I want to persuade buyers that gas prices are going to be as high as possible,"" Mr. Eads said. ""The buyers are big boys -- they are giant companies with thousands of gas economists who know way more than I know. Caveat emptor.""</p>              <p>Investment banking revenue at Jefferies reached $1.1 billion in 2011, a record for the firm, up from $750 million in 2007. Energy deals were cited among the biggest drivers of that surge, which came despite major problems at the firm because of its exposure to European sovereign debt.</p>              <p>Mr. Eads would not say how much he had been compensated for this bonanza. But Dealogic, a firm that tracks Wall Street transactions, estimated that Jefferies collected at least $124 million in fees from Chesapeake since 2007, a large share of its overall revenue on oil and gas deals, which ranged between $390 million and $700 million during the same period, according to two different industry estimates.</p>              <p>Even before the recent round of deals, Mr. Eads was a wealthy man. He lives in a sprawling, 11,000-square-foot lakefront mansion in Houston and has a wine cellar with 6,500 bottles. In 2010, he bought an $8.2 million home in the exclusive West End of Aspen, Colo., whose other homeowners have included Jack Nicholson and Mariah Carey. </p>              <p>Mr. Eads's success has produced no shortage of jealousy in Houston. </p>              <p>""A lot of people don't like him because he got ahead of everyone else,"" said Chip Johnson, chief executive of Carrizo Oil and Gas, who made two big deals in which Mr. Eads was involved. ""He got the reputation for overselling, but I have a hard time believing you can fool the big companies."" </p>              <p>""Without him,"" Mr. Johnson added, ""the country would not have had the huge gas supply as quickly as we did.""</p>              <p>Others have been more critical.</p>              <p>""He is like the bartender serving drinks for people who can't handle it,"" said Fadel Gheit, a managing director at Oppenheimer &amp; Company, about Mr. Eads. ""And the whole gas industry has gotten a rude awakening, a hangover, with gas prices plummeting. The investment bankers were happy to help with a smile and get their cut."" </p>              <p> A Train Without Brakes</p>              <p>""Quit drilling,"" T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman, barked to his fellow board members at Exco Resources, a small, independent drilling company based in Dallas that, like Chesapeake, had made a big bet in the Haynesville. ""Shut her down.""</p>              <p>Mr. Pickens, 84, made billions of dollars as a hedge fund manager and wildcatter drilling for oil and gas. He borrowed heavily to build up the oil and gas reserves of Mesa Inc. in the late 1980s before losing the company during its financial difficulties a decade later, when drooping gas prices hurt its ability to repay debts and pay dividends. He wanted Exco to avoid a similar fate. </p>              <p>There was only one problem: under the contracts that Exco signed, it couldn't stop drilling. </p>              <p>The company followed Chesapeake's lead and struck its own $1.3 billion cash-and-carry deal with the BG Group, a British gas company. BG paid Exco $655 million in cash upfront and agreed to foot 75 percent of the bill for future drilling in the Haynesville in return for a share in future profits on the gas produced.</p>              <p>When the arrangement was made, it seemed like a winner all around. Exco had more than 53,000 acres of leases in the Haynesville, but like Chesapeake, it lacked the money it needed to drill on all the land. BG's financing helped Exco to increase the number of rigs it had working in the Haynesville to 22 from four.</p>              <p>Nevertheless, the agreement, negotiated by Goldman Sachs, came with some important strings attached: Exco had to keep all 22 rigs drilling for gas, even as the price was dropping. BG wanted to reach certain targets for drilling wells and producing gas in the United States, and it was intent on sticking with the plan, even if its partner now insisted that it made no economic sense.</p>              <p>""They are great partners, but they have their pedal down around the world, and we are part of that,"" Douglas H. Miller, Exco's chief executive, explained to Wall Street analysts last year.</p>              <p>Mr. Pickens was furious. ""We are stupid to drill these wells,"" he said in a recent interview. </p>              <p>But Exco was not alone. Many of its fellow gas companies -- including Chesapeake and Petrohawk -- had little choice through last year but to keep drilling, no matter how low the price fell or how big a glut was forming.</p>              <p>It wasn't just the cash-and-carry deals that were forcing them to drill.</p>              <p>The land that the natural gas companies had leased, in most cases, came with ""use it or lose it"" clauses that required them to start drilling within three years and begin paying royalties to the landowners or lose the leases.</p>              <p>Exco, Chesapeake and others initially boasted about how many acres they had managed to lock up. But after paying bonuses of up to $20,000 an acre to the landowners, the companies could not afford to lose the leases, even if the low price of natural gas meant that drilling more wells was a losing proposition.</p>              <p>The industry was also driven to keep drilling because of the perverse way that Wall Street values oil and gas companies. Analysts rate drillers on their so-called proven reserves, an estimate of how much oil and gas they have in the ground. Simply by drilling a single well, they could then count as part of their reserves nearby future well sites. In this case, higher reserves generally led to a higher stock price, even though some of the companies were losing money each quarter and piling up billions of dollars in debt.</p>              <p>Just as in the earlier real estate bubble, the main players publicly predicted success even as, privately, their doubts were growing, court documents show. </p>              <p>Mr. McClendon suggested in August 2008 to Wall Street analysts that he had fundamentally transformed the once-risky, century-old oil and gas business into something with the reliability of an assembly line.</p>              <p>""We consider ourselves to be in the gas manufacturing business, and that requires four inputs in our opinion -- those inputs are land, people, science and, of course, capital,"" Mr. McClendon told the analysts. ""We think that's pretty impressive and hope you do as well.""</p>              <p>But soon after, he told some Chesapeake employees that the company might have made some big mistakes. ""What was a fair price 90 days ago for a lease is now overpriced by a factor of at least 2x given the dramatic worsening of the natural gas and financial markets,"" Mr. McClendon wrote in an October 2008 e-mail that has since become public in a lawsuit against Chesapeake. </p>              <p>And as with so many other shale gas players, Chesapeake struck so many complicated financial deals that it couldn't stop ramping up the gas factory. </p>              <p>""At least half and probably two-thirds or three-quarters of our gas drilling is what I would call involuntary,"" Mr. McClendon acknowledged at one point. </p>              <p>For him, the drilling binge had some significant financial consequences. During the good times, Chesapeake paid him handsomely in cash and perks. He achieved a net worth of over $1 billion, and he made it to the Forbes list of the 400 wealthiest Americans. He bought homes in Bermuda, Colorado and Hawaii, as well as a stake in the Oklahoma City Thunder basketball team.</p>              <p>An unusual company program also allowed Mr. McClendon to buy a small personal stake in Chesapeake's wells. That is expected to reap more than $400 million for him over the 15- to 20-year life of the wells, although it has strained his personal finances for now. An investigation by Reuters detailed how Mr. McClendon had borrowed heavily from Chesapeake business partners to help finance his share of the wells' costs. That and other issues drew the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission, shook investor confidence in him and prompted a shake-up of Chesapeake's board that included the removal of Mr. McClendon as chairman. </p>              <p>(Mr. McClendon refused requests to be interviewed for this article, and he did not respond to a list of questions.)</p>              <p>Mr. Eads appears to have fared better. He had seen the coming crash, and, as any master salesman would, found a way to play both sides. He continued to persuade new investors of the great potential in shale while telling his longtime clients to cash out.</p>              <p>""It is a great time to sell,"" Mr. Eads recalled telling Terry Pegula, the founder of East Resources, who had built up his own operation in the Marcellus region of Pennsylvania from one well to 75 over the course of one year. ""With all these new plays popping up, I had a real concern gas prices would weaken."" </p>              <p>Mr. Eads then helped arrange what will go down as one of the great early paydays of the shale revolution: the 2010 sale of East Resources, which Mr. Pegula had started with $7,500 borrowed from family and friends, to Royal Dutch Shell for $4.7 billion. </p>              <p>There were a handful of other such profit takers, including the Houston businessman Floyd Wilson, who created a company in 2003 called Petrohawk Energy with the intention from the start of selling it. Petrohawk drilled its first Haynesville well in 2008. Last year, it sold itself to an Australian energy conglomerate, BHP Billiton, in a $15 billion deal that brought Mr. Wilson and other executives a payout worth at least $304 million. </p>              <p>But for many gas drillers, there has been only pain.</p>              <p>Exco, whose production of natural gas was still rising in the Haynesville as of early this year, saw its credit rating downgraded in May. It reported a loss of nearly $780 million for the first half of the year, before write-offs and other adjustments, even after it reduced its work force and rig count. BG, its joint venture partner, reported in July that it was taking a $1.3 billion write-down on its shale gas investments in the United States, including the Haynesville deal with Exco.</p>              <p>Plains Exploration, which celebrated its first deal with Chesapeake back in 2008, reported a loss for the first quarter this year, but has since shifted heavily away from gas to oil production and is making money again. Warm weather last winter exacerbated the glut to historic levels, reducing prices even further, since so little gas was needed to heat homes in many parts of the nation.</p>              <p>Chesapeake's stock price sank this year after it was revealed that Mr. McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and then used those investments as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans used mostly to pay for his share of the cost of drilling those wells. The company is trying to raise $14 billion this year by shedding assets, a goal it has almost reached with huge recent sales of West Texas oil and gas fields and pipelines to Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron.</p>              <p>To help the company through this difficult patch, Mr. McClendon turned to his old friend, Mr. Eads. Jefferies &amp; Company, joined by Goldman Sachs, offered Chesapeake an emergency $4 billion unsecured bridge loan, at 8.5 percent interest, to give the company a lifeline until it could sell enough assets to keep afloat. (The company says it intends to pay back the entire loan this year from recent sales.) </p>              <p>In hindsight, it should have been clear to everyone that a bust was likely to occur, with so many new wells being drilled and so much money financing them. </p>              <p>But everyone was too busy working out new deals to pay much heed.</p>              <p>The bust has certainly hit the Haynesville hard. Some local landowners, having spent their initial lease bonuses, are now deeply in debt. Local restaurants and other businesses are suffering steep losses now that so many drillers have left town.</p>              <p>""At this point we're struggling,"" said Shelby Spurlock, co-owner of Cafe 171 in the town of Mansfield. The restaurant is decorated with wall collages of drill worker uniforms from companies that are leaving the area. Once open from 4 a.m. to 10 p.m. and employing four servers, the restaurant has cut its hours and is down to two servers. ""Our very existence is in danger,"" she sighed. </p>              <p>Mr. Eads, ever the deal maker, is unfazed. He tells anyone who will listen that the price of natural gas will eventually recover. He is making money, meanwhile, helping struggling companies and opportunistic investors strike deals at the new, lower prices. </p>              <p>""These shale assets are forever,"" he said. ""They are going to produce for a hundred years."" </p>              <p>The Energy Rush: Articles in this series are examining the transformation of energy production in the United States.

The state-run Cnooc has been active, striking several partnerships in Canada and the United States.</p>              <p>Canada, in part, has welcomed the alliances.</p>              <p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper has been trying to create new markets to export Canadian energy, which is largely dependent on the United States for its exports. He has been courting China since the United States stalled approval of the Keystone XL pipeline project, which would move more oil sands production to the Gulf Coast.</p>              <p>On Friday, the government also approved a $5 billion acquisition of Progress Energy Resources of Canada by Petronas, the Malaysian state-owned oil and gas company.</p>              <p>But the Nexen deal has also reignited the controversy over strategic assets ending up in the hands of foreign owners. Seven years ago, Cnooc gave up on an $18.5 billion bid for Unocal of the United States after political opposition. Two years ago, Sinochem, a Chinese chemicals maker, backed away from buying the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan for similar reasons.</p>              <p>The Nexen bid prompted nationalistic concerns in Canada. Some conservative members of Parliament worried about Cnooc, which is an arm of the Chinese government, gaining control over energy assets generally controlled by Canadian provinces.</p>              <p>Recognizing the sensitivity of the deal, Mr. Harper noted that foreign investment rules would be changed to block companies owned by foreign governments from acquiring properties in Alberta oil sands in all but ""exceptional"" circumstances.</p>              <p>""Canadians generally, and investors specifically, should understand that these decisions are not the beginning of a trend, but rather the end of a trend,"" Mr. Harper said at a news conference. ""When we say that Canada is open for business, we do not mean that Canada is for sale to foreign governments.""</p>              <p>It is not clear how the directive will play out on the deal-making front.</p>              <p>Gordon Houlden, director of the China Institute at the University of Alberta, said that the government's new position might not be well received in China despite Canada's approval of the Nexen transaction. ""This will be a very mixed message for the Chinese,"" Mr. Houlden said. ""They had ambitions far beyond Nexen.""</p>              <p>He added that Canada's new stance could also constrain several major state-owned oil companies, particularly Statoil of Norway, which has significant investments in North America. ""This will create a major barrier to investors with some of the deepest pockets and who are prepared to think in terms of decades rather than quarters,"" he said.</p>              <p>The government's decision also did not necessarily quell criticism within Canada. Within seconds of the prime minister's release, Peter Julian, a member of Parliament for the opposition New Democrats, condemned the Nexen approval as an act of ""rubber stamping"" that did not reflect the views of most Canadians.</p>              <p>The government's shifting sentiments could curb the deal-making spirits of Chinese companies.</p>              <p>To help drive China's growth, the government has been amassing natural resources in North America, and in riskier areas like Africa and Venezuela. In North America, Chinese companies have mainly focused on taking stakes in energy companies, rather than buying them.</p>              <p>In July, Sinopec, a competitor to Cnooc, agreed to pay $1.5 billion for a piece of the North Sea operations of Talisman Energy, another Canadian oil company.</p>              <p>After agreeing to buy Nexen in July, Cnooc made several moves to gain the support of the Canadian government. The Chinese company announced plans to keep Nexen management and establish Calgary, Alberta, as its headquarters for North and Central America.</p>              <p>""The Chinese are likely not to look at the oil sands for a while,"" said Oliver Borgers, a Toronto lawyer with McCarthy Tétrault who frequently represents companies seeking approval of takeovers under Canada's foreign investment laws. ""The policy is not directed at them specifically, but it's going to have a major impact.""</p>              <p>But Canada may find it difficult to entirely rebuff the overtures of well-financed Chinese players. Major oil and gas deals require enormous financing, and Canada needs to further develop the oil sands. All of that takes money, which the Chinese government-owned companies have.</p>              <p>Nexen's own financial struggles prompted its relationship with the deep-pocketed Cnooc. Nexen, which was formed by the merger of two Canadian units of Occidental Petroleum in 1971, has struggled with weak production and profits. One of its core sources of reserves, Yemen, has been plagued by political instability.</p>              <p>Nexen has also run into trouble in its own backyard. OPTI Canada, Nexen's partner in an oil sands operation in Long Lake, Alberta, went bankrupt after a series of production delays. Cnooc then acquired OPTI Canada for $2.1 billion, giving the Chinese a 35 percent holding in the project.</p>              <p>""I'm not sure you can do without state-owned enterprises,"" said Burkard Eberlein, a professor of public policy at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Toronto. ""They're saying, 'We are open for business, but we are very suspicious of that kind of investor.'

"33","2012-12-28","Corporate News: Cnooc's New Tack Shows in Oil Deal","1256995371","Wall Street Journal","B.5","            >                             </title>            >                          <p>BEIJING -- One of China's largest oil companies is learning to tread softly when breaking down barriers in the U.S. energy patch.</p>              <p>As U.S. regulators scrutinize Cnooc Ltd.'s $15.1 billion bid to acquire Canada's Nexen Inc., which includes more than 200 blocks in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the oil giant has taken a subtler approach to securing control over U.S. assets than in its 2005 bid for Unocal Corp.</p>              <p>In addition to being the largest overseas acquisition by a Chinese company, the deal would put a Chinese oil-and-gas producer in the driver's seat to control exploration and development of U.S. energy fields for the first time. The deal, which won approval in Ottawa this month, now faces scrutiny from the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S.</p>              <p>The lessons of the Unocal debacle loom large for the Chinese oil industry. People close to Cnooc and Nexen are pinning hopes for a smooth regulatory review on the fact that Cnooc doesn't face competing bids to acquire Nexen and that Nexen's potentially controversial U.S. assets are a small part of the overall deal.</p>              <p>Cnooc appears to have learned from some of its mistakes in 2005, according to industry insiders. Public records show a more modest lobbying campaign than Cnooc's $2 million splurge to support its failed bid to acquire Unocal seven years ago. Nexen also has played a key role in the lobbying, helping to put a Canadian face on a Chinese-Canadian deal.</p>              <p>Following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, BP PLC agreed to put $20 billion into a fund under intense political pressure to compensate spill victims. ""Could we count on them to put aside the type of funds that BP did put aside? It is a key question,"" said Amy Jaffe, a University of California, Davis, energy expert.</p>              <p>Cnooc says it had adopted industry best practices and was well-suited to respond to potential problems. In a statement, it described the 2010 spill as ""a significant wake-up call to every player in our industry.""</p>              <p>Chinese companies including Cnooc are already invested in the U.S. energy patch. Earlier investments included minority stakes in unconventional oil-and-gas assets that could propel the U.S. to become the world's largest oil producer by 2020, according to the International Energy Agency.</p>              <p>Nexen didn't respond to requests for comment. In an earlier statement, the company said discussions with Cifus were continuing ""with a view to completing the Cifus review process as expeditiously as possible.""</p>              <p>A successful acquisition of Nexen's assets would deepen Cnooc's toehold in the Gulf of Mexico and provide a platform for future exploration and production. Cnooc listed ""access to deep water expertise"" in the Gulf as among the deal's key benefits.</p>              <p>Those assets include the deep water Aspen field, which Nexen operates. The field is located at a depth of 3,150 feet, according to Nexen, and analysts expected Cnooc to rely heavily on Nexen's experience in deep water operations there.</p>              <p>Nexen said its share of Gulf of Mexico production in 2011 was relatively small, around 22,600 barrels of oil equivalent a day, but it has touted recent exploration successes.</p>              <p>U.S. and Canadian lobbying records show efforts to advocate for Cnooc and Nexen. Cnooc spent $170,000 on lobbying in the third quarter, according to the records. In Canada, Cnooc hired Hill + Knowlton Strategies months before announcing the deal. The firm arranged meetings with senior government bureaucrats who would be involved later in reviewing the bid, according to government lobbying records.</p>              <p>Cnooc also had Lawson Hunter of law firm Stikeman Elliott LLP. Mr. Hunter is a former senior executive at Canadian telecommunications titan BCE Inc. and an authority on the country's foreign investment and competition laws.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Paul Vieira and Keith Johnson contributed to this article.</p>              <p>Subscribe to WSJ:</p>              <p>Credit: By Brian Spegele</p>                      "
"34","2013-01-16","Cool Oil Vs. Hot Deals","1269600458","Wall Street Journal","C.1","            >                             </title>            >                          <p>[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</p>              <p>Last year was the best ever for mergers and acquisitions in the oil patch.</p>              <p>It also was the best ever for average oil prices. It isn't hard to see the link: Bullish markets tend to breed confidence. Right now, analysts forecast a slight drop in oil prices this year and hopes for U.S. natural gas have receded amid mild weather.</p>              <p>But energy bankers hoping for another big year of M&amp;A shouldn't fret too much -- fear also is a potent corporate aphrodisiac and could make 2013 another bumper year for deals.</p>              <p>Announced M&amp;A for upstream oil and gas, the exploration-and-production side of the business, totaled $252.2 billion last year. That is according to two new reports by energy research firm IHS Herold due to be published this week and in March. That quarter of a trillion is up 70% on 2011 and beats the previous record year of 2010. According to Dealogic, oil and gas was the hottest sector for M&amp;A overall last year.</p>              <p>This wasn't just a function of higher oil prices juicing average multiples and therefore deal sizes. The overall number of energy deals also was higher than for 2010 and 2011, and the global average for dollars paid per barrel of reserves has actually fallen since 2010.</p>              <p>The total for 2012 was boosted by Rosneft's $56 billion acquisition of TNK-BP. Discounting that unique situation -- combining Russian politics and BP's disaster-inspired cash needs -- serves to highlight the major trend in energy M&amp;A: the rise of North America. Absent that deal, 65% of upstream transactions last year involved targets in the U.S. and Canada, according to IHS data.</p>              <p>Besides relatively open access to resources, the big draw is the boom in unconventional resources such as shale. Deals involving these accounted for 27% of total M&amp;A last year and virtually all of those assets were located in North America.</p>              <p>North America is likely to remain the hottest area for deals this year -- and that is where price weakness could actually help. While high energy prices engender exuberance, low prices can bring even reluctant sellers to the table. After all, the megamergers of the late 1990s creating the likes of Exxon Mobil were in part a reaction to oil prices crashing to under $10 a barrel.</p>              <p>The U.S. E&amp;P sector's dash for growth leaves it vulnerable if energy prices weaken. At current futures prices, the average E&amp;P company is set to plow 150% of its cash flow into finding and developing reserves this year, according to Deutsche Bank.</p>              <p>Meanwhile, the sector's very success undermines energy prices: U.S. output increases alone should meet global oil-demand growth this year, according to Eurasia Group.</p>              <p>If cash-flow shortfalls widen, E&amp;P growth plans and balance sheets would likely come under pressure and, with them, valuations. That could force companies to put more assets on the market to raise cash -- as has happened with Chesapeake Energy in recent years -- or leave them vulnerable to takeover.</p>              <p>As it is, it looks cheaper to buy barrels on the stock market via deals than drill for them right now. Sanford C. Bernstein says the Western oil majors, including the likes of Exxon and Chevron, now trade at an average enterprise value of less than $15 a barrel of oil equivalent of proved reserves. This metric is shorthand for the value investors place on reserves, enabling comparisons between companies and with the costs of finding and developing reserves via drilling. Right now, those finding-and-development costs are $18.</p>              <p>Surveying 90 companies, J.P. Morgan Chase estimates E&amp;P capital expenditure globally last year at almost $480 billion, a record. So far this year, announced budgets are running 8% higher than in 2012. Not only will that fuel industry cost inflation, it suggests there is plenty of budgeted investment that could be redeployed into acquisitions if valuations became too tempting to ignore.</p>              <p>Among the biggest spenders are the national oil companies, those state-backed oil giants such as PetroChina. They also happen to account for a growing share of M&amp;A. Last year, Asian national oil companies gobbled up $57 billion of foreign oil-and-gas resources, according to IHS, representing 23% of overall upstream M&amp;A. Chinese companies accounted for more than half of that.</p>              <p>With oil and gas demand in emerging markets still growing, their national energy champions will likely keep pushing to secure resources around the world. China also is keen to gain foreign expertise in developing its shale basins, while Japan's chronic lack of domestic energy resources has been exacerbated by its turn against nuclear power since the Fukushima disaster.</p>              <p>Credit Suisse estimates that if China, India, Japan and South Korea wanted to directly own 25% of the oil supplying their economies, they would need to develop or buy up to three million barrels a day of output. Assuming a reserves-to-production ratio of 14 years -- oil majors generally want enough to meet more than a decade of output -- this implies they would need to own an extra 12.8 billion barrels in the ground. To put that in perspective, it is a bit more than Exxon's entire proved oil reserves at the end of 2012.</p>              <p>One thing bankers are unlikely to see is more takeovers of large North American E&amp;P companies by national oil companies similar to Cnooc's $15.1 billion acquisition of Nexen. That was approved by Canadian authorities last month. But Ottawa signaled that such deals are unlikely to get its blessing in the future. The U.S. also likely remains off-limits for takeovers of E&amp;P firms by national oil companies.</p>              <p>That doesn't stop Western majors who were late to the shale game targeting E&amp;P companies, though, and Canada's Encana, for example, looks vulnerable after the sudden departure of its chief executive last week. As for national oil companies, even if full corporate takeovers are politically tricky, they can buy smaller assets in North America. Indeed, asset purchases account for 61% of all oil-and-gas deals there over the past three years, according to IHS.</p>              <p>So there is a good chance energy bankers will again be popping champagne corks this time next year. To be sure of that, though, two things would help. One is a good idea of which North American E&amp;P firms are stretching to pay the bills. The other is a long list of oil contacts in Beijing, New Delhi and wherever else the big money resides in Asia.</p>              <p>Subscribe to WSJ:</p>              <p><object class=""mstar_link_to_media""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""6""/><param name=""mstar_lm_alignment"" value=""Left""/><param name=""mstar_lm_display_control"" value=""Embed""/><param name=""mstar_lm_pred_equation"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_type"" value=""Illustration""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_id"" value=""1""/></object></p>              <p>Credit: By Liam Denning</p>                      "

The pace and prominence of Chinese dealmaking is only going to rise in coming years, he argues, as China loosens the rules governing its financial sector, looks to diversify uses of its ample foreign currency earnings, and bids for new technologies and skills.</p>              <p>""China is now the second largest economy in the world. They are going to surpass the U.S. And they are only starting their foreign direct investment,"" Hanemann said. ""There are billions and billions of dollars to come.""</p>              <p>The Obama administration this week approved the acquisition of bankrupt Massachusetts battery maker A123 by a Chinese firm, a deal opposed by some members of Congress because of federal grants the company had received and because of its work on defense contracts.</p>              <p>Despite the controversy over such deals as the purchase of A123 - or the rejected acquisition of an Oregon wind farm close to a U.S. military facility - Chinese ownership of U.S. companies and property remains small compared to the amounts owned by firms or residents from elsewhere, and the majority of deals move ahead with little public notice.</p>              <p>Chinese companies invested $6.5 billion in the United States last year. That's a record and a 17 percent increase over the prior year, according to data assembled by the Rhodium Group.</p>              <p>But it's also about the same as Spain, a country whose multinationals have been seeking markets outside the beleagured euro zone.</p>              <p>It is also small compared to overall foreign direct investment -- the long-term acquisitions of companies, real estate or other hard assets. Before the economic crisis, the United States was typically receiving around $250 billion a year in foreign direct investment, and the figure was back near that by 2011.</p>              <p>What's been generally constant is the nationality of the investors - with typically heavy flows from Europe and close economic partners such as Japan. According to International Monetary Fund data as of the end of 2011, the United Kingdom and Japan between them accounted for more than a quarter of the estimated $2.5 trillion stock of foreign direct investment in the country.</p>              <p>Neither is China high on the list of sensitive deals, according to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the Treasury-led group that reviews any investments with national security implications. In the most recent CFIUS report, which covers calendar year 2011, Chinese companies were involved in 10 deals that triggered a CFIUS review - placing the country third, behind France (14) and the United Kingdom (25). In a separate list of transactions involving only ""critical technology companies,"" however, China was ninth: Only four deals involving Chinese firms fit that more sensitive description, compared to 30 from the U.K., 13 from France, 8 from Japan, 7 each from Canada and the Netherlands, 6 from Germany, and 5 each from Israel and Switzerland.</p>              <p>In a large and relatively open economy, of course, the whole point is for foreign-owned companies to go about their business of hiring, investing and selling with little attention to the fact that they are, for lack of a better term, foreign. Do workers at a Subaru plant in Indiana think about their Japanese connections? Do shoppers at a Zara clothing store realize its Spanish roots?</p>              <p>And the same is largely true for China: Buy a movie ticket at Mazza Gallerie or in Georgetown these days and it's to the benefit of China's Dalian Wanda Group, which purchased the AMC movie chain last year.</p>              <p>schneiderh@washpost.com</p>                      "

But it hasn't kept pace with changing buying habits for computers and has largely sat sidelined as tablets and smartphones gained popularity and PC sales shrunk.</p>              <p>People familiar with the deal talks have said stockholders would be offered a price of around $13 to $14 a share. Sunday evening, the share price was still being negotiated, one of the people said. Before news of the talks emerged Jan. 14, Dell shares had been trading just shy of $11. Friday, the stock rose 3% to $13.63, giving the company a market value of about $23.7 billion.</p>              <p>As of Sunday night, the contours of the deal appeared in line with previous reports about it. Investors who would own the company include Mr. Dell, who already owns nearly 16% of the shares; software titan Microsoft Corp.; and private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners. Four investment banks are lined up to raise about $15 billion in debt to help fund the deal, which is also expected to tap some cash from Dell's balance sheet.</p>              <p>Among the sticking points in the negotiations has been the nature of the Microsoft investment, Microsoft's role in the governance of the new company and what the investment would mean for the two companies' commercial relationship.</p>              <p>The issues have been under discussion, the people said, since Microsoft proposed in January to contribute $2 billion or more of equity in the form of a preferred security as part of a take-private deal.</p>              <p>Dell, the world's third-largest PC maker after Hewlett-Packard Co. and China's Lenovo Group Ltd., is one of the biggest channels for Microsoft's Windows operating software. Under one scenario that has been discussed, Dell would agree to use Microsoft's Windows software to power the vast majority of its devices, one of the people familiar with the discussions has said.</p>              <p>Debt investors and private-equity executives have been watching the Dell talks closely as a test of both investors' hunger for big buyout deals and private-equity firms' willingness to pursue them.</p>              <p>With interest rates so low for so long, investors in debt markets have become hungry for deals like buyouts that can offer more-attractive yields. Private-equity firms can get better returns on their money when the debt they can raise for buyouts is relatively inexpensive.</p>              <p>At the same time, some say a Dell deal won't necessarily usher in a wave of big private-equity buyouts, partly because this deal is expected to rely on equity from Microsoft and Mr. Dell, the type of capital sources not every deal can tap.</p>              <p>Blackstone Group LP President Hamilton ""Tony"" James, when asked last week on a conference call whether a Dell deal would open the door to bigger buyouts, responded: ""The simple answer is no.""

The buyout would give Mr. Dell the largest stake in the company, ensuring that the 47-year-old is the one who gets to oversee any changes.</p>              <p>The Round Rock, Texas, firm once boasted a market capitalization above $100 billion as the world's largest PC maker. But the company's market share has since dwindled to third behind Hewlett-Packard Co. and Lenovo Group Ltd. as tablets and smartphones became more popular.</p>              <p>Mr. Dell has also had to endure critical comparisons of the financial performance of his company and Apple Inc., a matter of particular frustration, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>              <p>Interviews with current and former Dell executives, plus other people who know the CEO, paint a picture of a man who appeared increasingly worried about his legacy. These people said it has been years since Mr. Dell showed the enthusiasm he did when he reclaimed the title of CEO in 2007 after a short period where he served only as chairman of the PC maker.</p>              <p>Mr. Dell didn't respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the company declined to comment.</p>              <p>Dell shares slipped 2.6% Monday to $13.27 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.</p>              <p>As part of the deal to go private, Mr. Dell would contribute his nearly 16% stake valued at about $3.7 billion, plus $700 million from an investment firm he controls, the people said. Microsoft would invest about $2 billion in the form of a subordinated debenture, a less-risky investment than common stock.</p>              <p>Microsoft isn't expected to get board seats or governance rights in a closely held Dell, one of the people said. Instead, the companies would tighten their relationship regarding use of Microsoft's Windows software, the person said.</p>              <p>Silver Lake Partners would invest more than $1 billion. Four banks are expected to arrange about $15 billion in debt to help fund the deal, and each would handle about a quarter of that amount, one of the people said.</p>              <p>The move to take the computer maker private is as much about Dell the man as Dell the company. ""It's pretty simple: His name is on the door,"" one former company executive said of Mr. Dell.</p>              <p>When Mr. Dell, who started the company in 1984 in his dorm room at the University of Texas, returned in January 2007, he promised to reposition the company for the new age.</p>              <p>Mr. Dell brought in several new executives, including ones to run operations, marketing and lead Dell's consumer push. But while sales grew during Mr. Dell's first year back, he couldn't sustain the momentum. The operations and marketing chiefs left after less than two years. The consumer chief left in 2010, after failed attempts at music players, phones and high-end laptops.</p>              <p>Mr. Dell began taking a step back from public scrutiny. In 2011, he stopped making prepared remarks on Dell's earnings calls, leaving that to his finance chief and other lieutenants.</p>              <p>Mr. Dell still dominated operational reviews, said people who attended the meetings, and he sometimes appeared to focus more on minutiae than big strategic decisions. Several years ago, Mr. Dell wrote a four-page memo after he first played with the XPS One, a high-end desktop that embedded all its parts inside the monitor. Mr. Dell's notes, sent late the night he received the machine, included his thoughts on the Styrofoam used to package the computer.</p>              <p>By late 2010, Mr. Dell had largely abandoned his efforts to develop products for consumers and advocated a new path to become a one-stop shop for businesses. He spent billions acquiring makers of security software, storage systems and other products, with an eye toward reinventing itself as a smaller International Business Machines Corp.</p>              <p>The products for businesses have a higher margin than PCs, but so far haven't been able to offset declines in the PC business, which still accounts for half of Dell's annual $62 billion in revenue. Overall, PC sales dropped 13% in the first three quarters of the company's fiscal 2013. Total revenue was down 7% over that period.</p>              <p>While Mr. Dell hasn't said what he might do with a closely held Dell, analysts said Dell now has most of the pieces it needs to become a one-stop technology shop. But it has to make those pieces work together, both technologically and organizationally.</p>              <p>A private Dell could focus on that and possibly exit some lower-margin parts of the PC business, such as retail sales to consumers, they said.</p>              <p>Mr. Dell has tried to position Dell as something other than a PC company, pointing out that the machines account for just a third of Dell's profits.</p>              <p>The people who have worked with him expect some changes to the PC business, but don't anticipate Mr. Dell will stop making PCs altogether.</p>              <p>Indeed, Mr. Dell has appeared wedded to PCs. When Hewlett-Packard briefly considered spinning out its PC business in 2011, Mr. Dell in private conversations derided the idea as a big mistake.</p>              <p>Mr. Dell has said that some of the PC industry's changes caught him unaware.</p>              <p>When asked in a 2011 interview with The Wall Street Journal what surprised him most since he returned as Dell CEO in 2007, Mr. Dell said the rise of tablets had been unexpected for him.</p>              <p>""I didn't completely see that coming,"" he said, before adding that he didn't anticipate business users would give up PCs soon.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Ian Sherr and Don Clark contributed to this article.</p>              <p>Subscribe to WSJ:</p>              <p>Credit: By Ben Worthen and Anupreeta Das</p>                      "

Sinopec's refining business, for example, sometimes runs at a loss due to government controls on fuel prices.

It has done it before. It put billions into Nokia Corp. to get its software on smartphones and pays Yahoo Inc. to bolster its Bing search engine.</p>              <p>The loan Microsoft is providing the world's No. 3 PC maker is a small financial bet for Microsoft, which had $68.3 billion in cash and short-term securities at year-end and generates about $2 billion in cash each month.</p>              <p>But as a Dell creditor, Microsoft could see its relationships with other hardware allies fray. That is something the maker of Windows has been increasingly willing to risk to achieve its business goals after missing out on fast-growing computing markets such as tablets and smartphones.</p>              <p>Microsoft annoyed some PC makers last year when it started selling its first homegrown computer, the Surface. Now, Microsoft will have to allay concerns that it will favor Dell over other computer vendors, including Hewlett-Packard Co., Lenovo Group Ltd. and Acer Inc.</p>              <p>Since the Surface's release, H-P and Lenovo have begun building laptops that run software from Google Inc. Some analysts said the Dell deal will give PC makers more leverage to negotiate more favorable licensing terms with Microsoft.</p>              <p>""For Microsoft, it crossed the Rubicon when it shipped the Surface, and relationships with PC manufacturers will never be the same,"" said Brad Silverberg, a venture capitalist and former Microsoft executive.</p>              <p>Microsoft said on Tuesday it is ""committed to the long term success of the entire PC ecosystem"" and ""will continue to look for opportunities to support partners."" A spokesman declined further comment.</p>              <p>Dell Chief Financial Officer Brian Gladden said in an interview that Microsoft was committed to the PC industry at large and to helping Dell. In a regulatory filing, Dell reaffirmed its commitment to the PC business, saying it ""is critical to our financial and cash flow models.""</p>              <p>Microsoft won't have a direct role in the management or oversight of Dell. The Microsoft investment, which people familiar with the matter described as similar to high-yield debt, doesn't come with a board seat, equity ownership or formal strategic involvement.</p>              <p>Other PC makers declined to comment Tuesday on Microsoft's role in the Dell buyout, though they suggested the deal would help their business. ""Dell has a very tough road ahead,"" said rival H-P, noting, ""Dell's customers will now be eager to explore alternatives.""</p>              <p>Lenovo said ""we are focused on our products, customers and overall execution rather than distracting financial maneuvers and major strategic shifts.""</p>              <p>Dell Chief Executive Michael Dell first approached the company's board about a buyout last August. Microsoft had considered taking part in the deal in December or earlier but only joined the discussions last month at the request of Silver Lake Partners.</p>              <p>Neither Silver Lake nor Dell needed Microsoft's money to complete the $24.4 billion buyout, according to a person familiar with the deal. But in the wake of the Surface controversy, Silver Lake wanted to ensure strong ties between Microsoft and Dell, this person said.</p>              <p>The choice was between taking on $2 billion more in high-yield debt or bringing in Microsoft as a ""passive debt investor"" who would be ""emotionally and financially committed"" to Dell's future, a person said.</p>              <p>Some Microsoft-watchers said the Dell investment is a smart bet to keep a key partner in the game and with a vested interest in Microsoft's Windows operating system. Dell is responsible for roughly one out of every 10 new computers running Windows. Dell also is an important player in corporate computing gear such as servers, for which Microsoft also sells software.</p>              <p>""Microsoft's Windows PC franchise is only as strong as its [computer hardware] partners,"" said Patrick Moorhead, president of research firm Moor Insights &amp; Strategy.</p>              <p>Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has long-standing personal and professional relationships with Mr. Dell. The Round Rock, Texas, company kept mum as other PC makers publicly criticized Microsoft's strategy or sales pace for Windows 8, the revamped operating software that Microsoft launched last fall to help take the company and its PC allies into the tablet market.</p>              <p>But if shareholders approve Dell's buyout, the company won't necessarily remain wedded to Microsoft software, said a person familiar with the Dell deal. Some analysts believe Dell might branch out from Microsoft's Windows and opt to build computers, tablets, phones or more back-end servers running software from rivals such as Google's Chrome or Android.</p>              <p>A Google spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>              <p>One comfort for Microsoft: An investment it previously made in a computer maker turned out well for both.

Starting in 2000, Microsoft sold its Apple stock at a sizable profit.</p>              <p>""Microsoft has shown an ability to be a smart investor and achieve strategic goals dating back to the investments in Apple"" and others, said Liberty Media Corp.

So are many firms that can be tied to national security or critical technologies. Still, Chinese firms are stepping up their investments in the U.S. by targeting smaller companies, going after minority stakes and avoiding the most sensitive acquisition targets.</p>              <p>China hasn't given up on big deals. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., a government group that reviews foreign acquisitions, is expected to decide in coming weeks whether to approve two multibillion-dollar deals by Chinese firms. A Cfius spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>              <p>The deals getting the green light so far are smaller. Last week, U.S. regulators approved the Chinese acquisition of a U.S. battery maker despite political resistance and an initially icy reception. Wanxiang America Corp., a unit of China's Wanxiang Group, is paying $257 million to buy A123 Systems, a U.S. government-backed maker of lithium-ion batteries, after an early attempt at a purchase collapsed.</p>              <p>""You just need to understand the rules, follow the rules, be very transparent and let them make the decision,"" says Pin Ni, president of Wanxiang America, who started the U.S. offshoot out of a home office in Chicago.</p>              <p>Last year, Chinese buyers agreed to spend more than $10 billion in 46 deals to acquire U.S. companies or stakes in U.S. firms, according to Dealogic. The volume was higher than the Chinese total from 2009 through 2011 combined. The tally included the sale of Kansas City, Mo.-based movie-theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings to Wanda Group for $700 million.</p>              <p>The U.S. still trails Canada, where Chinese firms announced $23 billion worth of deals for Canadian companies or stakes last year. The total includes the pending $15.1 billion acquisition of Canadian oil-sands operator Nexen Inc. by Cnooc Ltd., the Chinese state energy giant.</p>              <p>The Nexen deal requires U.S. approval, since Nexen owns significant assets scattered across the U.S. coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Last month, Nexen and Cnooc extended the deadline to complete the deal to March 2 from Jan. 31 to allow Cfius time to deliberate. Authorities in Canada, the U.K., European Union and China already have approved the takeover.</p>              <p>Most of last year's U.S.-China deals involved small companies or the purchase of minority stakes. Many bigger takeovers get ruled out by potential Chinese bidders because they don't think the transactions will be approved, say bankers and lawyers who advise the companies on deals.</p>              <p>In a 2005 deal that became a symbol of anti-Chinese sentiment, Cnooc abandoned its $18.5 billion attempt to buy U.S. oil producer Unocal Corp. amid what Cnooc called ""unprecedented political opposition."" Congress at the time inserted a provision into an energy bill that would have delayed the takeover for months. Unocal was later acquired by Chevron Corp.</p>              <p>Some big Chinese acquisitions still are being stymied.</p>              <p>Superior Aviation Beijing Co. abandoned in October its $1.79 billion bid to buy the corporate-jet and propeller-plane operations of Hawker Beechcraft Inc. because it was too complicated to separate those businesses from the Wichita, Kan., company's defense business, which would have been off limits, people familiar with the deal said at the time.</p>              <p>A congressional report published in October warned U.S. business against working with Chinese telecommunications firms Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., saying their equipment could become a vehicle for Chinese spying in the U.S. Both companies have rejected the allegations, and Huawei called the findings politically motivated.</p>              <p>To avoid clashing with U.S. regulators, many Chinese companies are going after investments of less than $500 million, focusing mostly on closely held companies. Chinese firms sometimes aim for joint ventures or less-formal partnerships rather than all-out acquisitions.</p>              <p>But Chinese firms are getting more ambitious. Cfius signed off last month on the $118 million takeover of Complete Genomics Inc., a Mountain View, Calif., DNA sequencer by China's BGI-Shenzhen. That was the first acquisition of a publicly traded U.S. company by a Chinese firm.</p>              <p>A123 Systems was an especially sensitive deal because the Waltham, Mass., company got nearly $250 million in grants from the Department of Energy in 2009 to build a factory in Michigan. A123 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October, but Wanxiang America's first try at buying the battery maker flopped because of regulatory concerns.</p>              <p>On Wanxiang's second try, more than two dozen members of Congress wrote to Cfius to urge careful scrutiny of the deal. They argued that taxpayer-funded technology would land in the hands of a Chinese buyer.</p>              <p>To salvage the acquisition, Wanxiang agreed to sell off A123's business that sells batteries to the government while keeping the unit that sells commercial batteries. The Chinese company has said it intends to keep the Michigan factory in operation.</p>              <p>The Chinese company did extensive legwork to size up parts of the business that could be sensitive to U.S. officials and hired U.S.-based law firm Sidley Austin LLP to help manage the process, Mr. Pin says.</p>              <p>The biggest China-U.S. deal announced last year still needs approval from U.S. regulators. American International Group Inc. wants to sell up to 80.1% of its aircraft leasing business, International Lease Finance Corp., to a consortium of Chinese financial-services firms for $4.23 billion. Anticipating potential U.S. regulatory hurdles because of the deal's size, the consortium hired U.S.-based lawyers, a New York public relations firm and structured the deal in two parts. In addition to the initial stake, the group has the option to buy another 9.9% later.</p>              <p>Subscribe to WSJ:</p>              <p><object class=""mstar_link_to_media""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""6""/><param name=""mstar_lm_alignment"" value=""Left""/><param name=""mstar_lm_display_control"" value=""Embed""/><param name=""mstar_lm_pred_equation"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_type"" value=""Illustration""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_id"" value=""1""/></object></p>              <p><object class=""mstar_link_to_media""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""6""/><param name=""mstar_lm_alignment"" value=""Left""/><param name=""mstar_lm_display_control"" value=""Embed""/><param name=""mstar_lm_pred_equation"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_type"" value=""Illustration""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_id"" value=""2""/></object></p>              <p>Credit: By Sharon Terlep</p>                      "

Chesapeake shares declined 6.8%, or $1.39, to $19.11 at 4 p.m. Monday in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>              <p>Chesapeake is still reeling from a collapse in U.S. natural-gas prices, while it attempts an expensive shift to more profitable oil drilling. The second-largest natural-gas producer in the U.S., after Exxon Mobil Corp., is selling assets to address an expected $4 billion funding shortfall.</p>              <p>The Sinopec deal also would increase state-owned Chinese oil and gas producers' rapidly expanding foothold in the North American oil patch. Sinopec, known formally as Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration &amp; Production Corp., entered a $2.5 billion joint venture with Devon Energy Corp. in January 2012 to drill in the Mississippi Lime. Cnooc Ltd., meanwhile, just concluded a $15 billion takeover of Canada's Nexen Energy in the largest overseas acquisition by a Chinese state-owned energy company. In 2010 and 2011, Cnooc bought stakes in Chesapeake's oil-rich shale fields in south Texas, as well as fields in Colorado and Wyoming.</p>              <p>The latest deal ""moves us further along in achieving our asset-sales goals and secures an excellent partner to share the capital costs required"" to develop this large area, said Chesapeake's chief operating officer, Steven C. Dixon.</p>              <p>Chesapeake and other natural-gas producers have been hurt by a glut of the resource that stems from their use of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to unlock gas from shale formations. The resulting production surge caused prices to collapse to a 10-year low, below $2 a million British thermal units last April. Chesapeake posted shrinking revenue and chose to sell more than $10 billion in assets last year to improve its balance sheet.</p>              <p>Chesapeake Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon said in November that the company marketed its Mississippi Lime acres for most of 2012 to Asian energy companies, but added at the time that reaching a potential deal ""became more complicated"" as regulators increased scrutiny of foreign companies trying to invest in U.S. energy assets.</p>              <p>The stamp of approval that the Canadian and U.S. governments recently gave to Cnooc's $15 billion takeover of Nexen might have calmed those fears, said China energy analyst Robert Gee, head of Gee Strategies Group LLC.</p>              <p>""The Nexen deal was obviously critical in communicating a signal -- it gave a green light"" for Chinese investment in exploration and production in the U.S. and Canada, he said.</p>              <p>Chesapeake's deal with Sinopec would give the Chinese company a 50% interest in 850,000 of Chesapeake's net oil and natural-gas leasehold acres in the Mississippi Lime. Chesapeake will receive about 90% of proceeds upon the deal's close, expected in the second quarter, with the remainder to be paid later.</p>              <p>The Mississippi Lime has been a target for companies using fracking techniques in search of oil, but so far there has been only moderate success. Chesapeake said it averaged 34,000 barrels a day of oil and natural gas in its Mississippi Lime wells in the fourth quarter.</p>              <p>Analysts applauded Chesapeake for landing the deal with Sinopec. But they also voiced concern that the company's need to sell helped undercut the final price tag by as much as $200 million.</p>              <p>Jefferies &amp; Co. advised Chesapeake on the deal.

Southeastern also approached the buyout group about joining a deal to take the company private while retaining an ownership stake, but the overture was rebuffed, said one person familiar with the matter. It currently owns 8.4% of the company.</p>              <p>Meanwhile, rival Hewlett-Packard Co. has itself eyed a takeover of Dell, several people said, though some of those people said that H-P had no plans to move ahead with a bid. Lenovo Group Ltd., the big Chinese computer maker, was approached but wasn't interested, some of those people said. Blackstone Group LP is expected to look at Dell's financial information, people familiar with the matter said, although there is no certainty the private-equity firm will pursue a deal.</p>              <p>Dell appeared to acknowledge that it has a fight ahead to complete a buyout at the proposed price. The special board committee that negotiated the buyout issued a statement earlier Wednesday defending its handling of the deal and reiterating it had considered several options for shareholders besides what it ultimately agreed upon -- a sale to Mr. Dell and private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners.</p>              <p>""The Special Committee has worked hard, and continues to work hard, to produce the best outcome for Dell's shareholders,"" the statement said. Dell is currently conducting a sale process to determine if other bidders could top the buyout team's offer. Its board is expected to hold a regularly scheduled meeting Thursday, according to someone familiar with that situation.</p>              <p>At stake is the future of the Round Rock, Texas, personal-computer pioneer, the competitive landscape for rivals and, for many shareholders, whether they win or lose on what has lately been a declining investment. The deal is also being widely watched to gauge the health of the market for buyouts, with Dell's set to be the largest private-equity buyout since the financial crisis if it is completed.</p>              <p>Shareholders' main complaint is the $13.65-a-share offer price. Southeastern has said the stock could be worth closer to $24 a share and it and others have laid out presentations to make their case for a higher price. Southeastern has said the deal provides the buyout group with a chance to transform Dell's results and then cash out with big returns, while leaving most shareholders out of that upside.</p>              <p>Dell shares rose 25 cents, or nearly 2%, to close at $14.32 Wednesday, suggesting investors expect the deal terms to improve.</p>              <p>Bloomberg reported that H-P and Blackstone have looked at a deal.</p>              <p>Dell, the world's third-largest computer maker, would offer a rival more market scale, which could drive down prices paid to suppliers. But in the case of H-P, the cost of a Dell deal is too high, a person familiar with the matter said. Also, the company's chief executive, Meg Whitman, has said the company won't make any big acquisitions soon and will instead focus on building up a cash reserve and paying down debt.</p>              <p>Dell has already begun its transformation, attempting to arrest declines in its revenue from a broad drop-off in PC sales. Once the world's largest PC maker, the company fell behind the times as the retail market shifted and tablets and mobile devices grew in popularity. Dell has struggled to become a bigger player in the lucrative business of providing technology services and software. Revenue in its recently completed fiscal year fell 8% while profit dropped 32%.</p>              <p>Last year, Mr. Dell, also chief executive, told his board he wanted to explore buying the company.</p>              <p>A strategic review ensued, and Dell said Feb. 5 it agreed to sell itself to a group led by Mr. Dell and Silver Lake, of Menlo Park, Calif. The private-equity industry cooed over the availability of billions of dollars in debt to fund such deals and called Dell a strong buyout candidate thanks to the approximate 15% stake Mr. Dell could contribute to the deal.</p>              <p>Quickly, however, shareholders began revolting. In addition to Southeastern, mutual fund company T. Rowe Price Group Inc., another large shareholder, also came out against the deal, along with several smaller holders.</p>              <p>This week, Southeastern released a new letter admonishing the board and seeking access to a list of company shareholders.</p>              <p>One point of the fight that is gaining increased attention is Southeastern's suggestion that Dell pay a large special dividend to shareholders.</p>              <p>Instead of Dell using its cash and raising debt to go private, those funds could deliver a $12-per-share dividend, Southeastern has argued. Dell's special committee said it had reviewed such a move in its strategic review but concluded a buyout was better for shareholders.</p>              <p>Still, the fate of the deal might not be resolved for some time.</p>              <p>The first key date is March 22, when the 45-day ""go shop"" period for the company to solicit other offers is set to end. That is when, if no better offer takes priority, the battle for the hearts of shareholders begins in earnest.</p>              <p>For the deal to pass, Dell must have a total of 42% of shares outstanding vote in favor of the deal. The holdings of Mr. Dell, his family and other insiders -- a total of 16% -- aren't counted in the key vote, and any shares that abstain count as ""no."" In other words, for the deal to pass, more than half of shareholders not affiliated with Mr. Dell must affirmatively vote ""yes.""</p>              <p>Southeastern, T. Rowe Price and other shareholders in the public ""nay"" column have tallied about 15%.</p>              <p>The undeclared shareholders can expect to face a blast of calls and pitches for the armies lining up on each side, say people familiar with such situations.</p>              <p>Both sides have hired proxy solicitors, firms that help lobby shareholders on the vote.

The Dell board committee said it was soliciting offers for the company and that it would ""welcome Carl Icahn and all other interested parties to participate in that process.""</p>              <p>Dell said that in the past it has considered a leveraged recapitalization and found it inferior to the proposal to go private.</p>              <p>Chief Executive and founder Michael Dell and private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners last month won board support for a $13.65-per-share offer, pending a 45-day hunt for better offers.</p>              <p>Mr. Icahn's move is expected to have some impact on the deal, but there is no guarantee it could alter the deal's current course. The merger agreement requires 42% of Dell's outside shareholders to approve the founder's buyout. Before Mr. Icahn's letter, holders of about 15% of shares have said they opposed the deal.</p>              <p>Some shareholders, sensing a higher offer isn't likely, have already voted by selling their shares.</p>              <p>""We thought the [proposed buyout] deal would go closer to $15 [a share],"" said Joanna Shatney, head of U.S. large-cap equities at Schroder Investment Management North America Inc. But Ms. Shatney said that rather than fight for more, the fund she managed was selling down its small Dell stake, which was less than 0.1% of the company, because ""we don't see a number of other suitors"" who could offer a better price.</p>              <p>In his letter to Dell board members disclosed by the computer maker on Thursday, Mr. Icahn argued the founder's offer undervalues the company and laid out a plan that he said valued Dell at $22.81 a share. He proposed the company use cash and debt to pay shareholders a $9-a-share special dividend and keep their shares rather than accept the buyout group's bid.</p>              <p>Mr. Icahn has acquired a less than 5% stake in Dell, people familiar with the matter said.</p>              <p>Buyout firm Blackstone Group LP separately is reviewing the company's financial information, although it is unclear that it would proceed with a bid, people familiar with the matter said. Some other companies considered bids but ultimately decided against making an offer.</p>              <p>Over the past few weeks, several Dell shareholders have opposed Mr. Dell's offer. Southeastern Asset Management Inc., Dell's largest outside shareholder, criticized the buyout at the current price and hired a firm to convince other shareholders to oppose the deal.</p>              <p>Southeastern's efforts lately have appeared to stall, however; the firm approached Mr. Dell's group about rolling its 8.4% stake into the buyout but was rebuffed, a person familiar with the matter said.</p>              <p>Hewlett-Packard Co. and Lenovo Group Ltd. were approached about getting involved in a deal that would derail the founder's offer, but decided not to move ahead, people familiar with the matter said.</p>              <p>Mr. Icahn's proposal ""definitely is going to cause, if it hasn't happened already, others to join the pack sensing a momentum shift,"" said Brad Allen, director of Branav Shareholder Advisory Services Inc., which works with boards to evaluate how shareholders will vote in a proxy contest.</p>              <p>The Dell team is weathering heavy criticism for its offering price, but under the merger agreement, it agreed to hold off releasing information on the company's financial conditions until after the go-shop period, said people familiar with the process. In documents that would be distributed to investors later this month, the company would lay out the math behind the deal and make the case that Dell exhausted all other options for the company, including a thorough search for other potential bidders, said these people. One person familiar with the matter said Dell's board didn't want to release portions of its argument in advance while it was trying to sell the company.</p>              <p>The outcome of the battle for votes may not become clear for several months. Active investors such as Mr. Icahn and Southeastern represent a relatively small portion of Dell's shareholder base. The largest block of Dell holders are passive index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.</p>              <p>About 18% of Dell Inc. shares were owned by passive index funds at the end of last year, according to an analysis by Ipreo, a markets data and advisory firm.</p>              <p>In his letter, Mr. Icahn said his Icahn Enterprises LP would be willing to lend Dell $2 billion and Mr. Icahn would personally lend $3.25 billion as bridge loans to assure the financing of the dividend. He has acquired a less than 5% stake in Dell, a person close to the matter said.</p>              <p>Mr. Icahn once had a different take on the company's value, said a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Icahn earlier discussed a possible bid for Dell, as part of the go-shop process. He is no longer considering a bid, the person said.</p>              <p>Separately, Mr. Icahn disclosed in a regulatory filing Thursday that he had boosted his stake in nutritional-supplement maker Herbalife Ltd. The increase, to 15.55% from about 13%, comes roughly a week after Herbalife agreed to name two of Mr. Icahn's designees to its board.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>David Benoit and Joann S.

There are other European chains that Wanda could target as well.</p>              <p>In addition to AMC, Wanda operates 1,000 screens in China, the world's second-largest movie market, and is aiming to expand to 2,000 by 2015, Chairman Wang Jianlin said last year.</p>              <p>Acquiring a big chain in Europe could make Wanda a major player in both ends of the film business; Mr. Wang has said he wants to invest in making movies in China and elsewhere. Wanda representatives have had talks with Hollywood studios about co-financing a slate of U.S. productions, people close to the discussions said.</p>              <p>Owning European theaters also could give the Chinese company significant leverage when negotiating the terms under which it splits box-office revenue with Hollywood studios.</p>              <p>""Exhibition has tended to be a territorial business,"" said David Hancock, an analyst at research and consulting firm Screen Digest. ""A major global chain could change the dynamics.""</p>              <p>Studios typically negotiate with theater chains on a market-by-market basis.

The company has made few changes in the film-buying practices at AMC since acquiring the chain.</p>              <p>Although countries such as China and Brazil have been growing faster, Europe remains a top movie market.

The firm is expected to put the chain up for sale again soon.</p>              <p>Wanda has also approached Vue Entertainment, but the British company doesn't want to sell, a person close to the discussions said.

But the Chinese company, whose telecommunications-equipment business has outpaced most Western rivals, thinks it can repeat the success with handsets.</p>              <p>To establish itself as a smartphone brand, Huawei is increasing marketing efforts and plans to offer a premium phone -- even as it faces controversy in the U.S. over its mainstay wireless-network business.</p>              <p>""Apple and Samsung are indeed in strong positions today, but things change so fast now,"" said Wan Biao, a Huawei board director who heads the company's handset business. Huawei's goal, Mr. Wan said, is to become a leading global brand for smartphones and other smart devices within the next five years.</p>              <p>There are many hurdles. Few consumers associate Chinese brands with premium gadgets, and Huawei's market presence is still mainly in the low-end segment. About half of the company's smartphones shipped globally last year were priced between $100 and $150, according to research firm Canalys.</p>              <p>Also not helping: Last year's U.S. congressional report citing concerns that Huawei's network equipment -- though not handsets -- might enable Beijing to spy on Americans. Huawei strongly denied the allegations.</p>              <p>""The perception in the U.S. is surely a challenge that we need to overcome,"" Mr. Wan said. It is important for Huawei's consumer products to deliver a positive message, he said.</p>              <p>In the fourth quarter last year, Huawei became the world's third-largest smartphone vendor behind Samsung and Apple, selling 10.8 million units world-wide in the quarter, according to research firm IDC. Still, Huawei missed its earlier target of selling 50 million to 60 million smartphones in 2012, selling only 32 million. This year, the company aims to sell 60 million units, Mr. Wan said.</p>              <p>Huawei is preparing what it has described as a new ""premium smartphone"" for the second half of this year, though the company declined to provide details on the new device. ""I think this year will be the year when we can bring more surprises to the industry,"" said Shao Yang, chief marketing officer for Huawei's handset business.</p>              <p>For years, Huawei -- which sells network equipment such as base stations, antennas and transmitters -- leveraged its long-established relationships with telecom operators to supply handsets marketed under the carriers' names. But in the past year, the company has shifted to Huawei-branded smartphones.</p>              <p>It has also opened more than 20 Huawei retail stores, mostly in China, and plans to open more in the Middle East and Latin America, the company said.</p>              <p>Other than Samsung and Apple, Huawei's rivals in the global smartphone market include HTC Corp. and Nokia Corp., as well as Chinese competitors such as Lenovo Group Ltd. and ZTE Corp.</p>              <p>Branding efforts will be important in markets such as India and Southeast Asia, where phones are sold mainly through open-market retailers rather than telecom carriers, according to Canalys analyst Rachel Lashford. And ""Huawei is still lacking high-end products that can really speak to consumers,"" she said.</p>              <p>Also, for many Western consumers, ""Huawei is a difficult name to pronounce,"" she added.</p>              <p>There were discussions in the past about whether to create a new brand name for consumer products, but Huawei -- pronounced HWA-wey -- has decided to keep its identity consistent, Mr. Yang said.</p>              <p>The company has made an effort to get its name out there. In November, it launched a $30 million global campaign for the year-end holiday to promote its Ascend line of smartphones. The two-month-long campaign featured an online game in which, according to Huawei, more than three million people participated.</p>              <p>In Europe, Huawei has been marketing at more sporting events. In August, it sponsored the Spanish professional soccer club Atletico de Madrid for the UEFA Super Cup, placing a big logo on each Atletico player's chest during the annual match organized by the Union of European Football Associations.</p>              <p>In 2012, Samsung spent $401 million advertising its phones in the U.S., while Apple spent $333 million, according to ad research and consulting firm Kantar Media.</p>              <p>Mr. Yang wouldn't disclose how much Huawei spends, but said the company wouldn't put as much on marketing as Apple and Samsung.</p>              <p>""Heavily investing in advertising is one model, but this is not the only model,"" Mr. Yang said.</p>              <p>Subscribe to WSJ:</p>              <p>Credit: By Juro Osawa</p>                      "

IBM's shares dropped 4.9% in after-hours trading on Thursday.</p>              <p>Lenovo said in a separate statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange that it is in preliminary negotiations with a ""third party in connection with a potential acquisition."" But it said it had not reached any agreements.</p>              <p>As when IBM announced plans to sell its personal computer business in 2004 -- also to Lenovo -- a sale would signal a sea change in the computing market.</p>              <p>The x86 servers were once a fast-growing and lucrative technology that lifted sales at companies like Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Inc., which still rely on them for billions of dollars in sales.</p>              <p>IBM, having struggled to compete with those companies, now may stop selling a product that produces the server market's highest volumes but lowest profit, according to industry analysts.</p>              <p>In 2012, IBM was the No. 3 player in the low-end server market after H-P and Dell, according to technology research firm Gartner. IBM ended the year with 15% of the market by revenue, down from 16.4% in 2011, according to Gartner. Meanwhile, H-P's share fell to 32.4% from 35%, and Dell's slipped to 21.4% from 21.8%.</p>              <p>Dell said it has seen strong growth in x86 servers. A spokesman for H-P declined to comment.</p>              <p>It wasn't clear how advanced IBM's talks with Lenovo were or whether a deal would materialize. Technology trade publication CRN reported the talks earlier Thursday.</p>              <p>IBM has a history of aggressively shifting its business mix to areas with better growth and higher profit margins. The company shocked the technology industry when it agreed to sell off its PC business to Lenovo before personal computers had been largely commoditized. IBM then beefed up its operations in higher margin software and consulting businesses.</p>              <p>A sale of the low-end part of the server business would fit this pattern, as new Chief Executive Virginia ""Ginni"" Rometty looks for ways to expand the company's revenue and earnings. A divestiture of the x86 business would mark Ms. Rometty's first major asset sale since taking over the top job a year ago.</p>              <p>IBM is likely to hold on to the higher end parts of its server business where it can generate a competitive advantage. IBM invests billions of dollars in research and development to help fuel the development of its mainframe computer business, where it remains the industry's dominant player. The company makes the computer chips, operating system and much of the infrastructure software that powers those machines.</p>              <p>The acquisition marks a significant shift in strategy for Lenovo as the Chinese company has primarily focused on PCs. Nonetheless, it has taken some steps to boost its server business. In an agreement last summer, Lenovo began cooperation with U.S. data-storage provider EMC Corp. to jointly develop and sell servers and network storage, a move broadly seen as a play by Lenovo to boost a still nascent business for the company.</p>              <p>Lenovo Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing said at the time the company is first targeting the China market before going abroad, and it is the company's goal to become the country's biggest provider of servers. Lenovo is a small but fast-growing player in the low end server market. Last year, the company saw more than $360 million in worldwide x86 server sales, up from about $154 million in 2010, according to tech research firm Gartner.</p>              <p>News of a possible sale came as IBM ran into trouble in the first quarter of 2013. The company said its profit fell 1% to $3.03 billion as its revenue dropped 5% to $23.41 billion.</p>              <p>The computer hardware business was a particular area of weakness. Total revenue for hardware systems declined 13% in the first quarter, and the business reported a pretax loss of $405 million. While sales of mainframes rose 7%, sales of IBM's x86 products -- ""System x"" -- fell 9%.</p>              <p>The market for x86 servers, named for the chip design used by Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., grew quickly in the 1990s as the Internet took off.

Regulators late last year stopped approving initial-public-offering applications in China, while the market in Hong Kong, another favored site for Chinese listings, has been sluggish.</p>              <p>UniTrust provides leasing services to clients in the health-care, education, machine-tools and printing industries. When TPG first invested in the company in 2008, UniTrust was focused heavily on the construction industry, but it has since diversified its revenue streams away from that sector, the person familiar with the matter said. TPG bought UniTrust, formerly known as Nissin Leasing, with an initial investment of about $320 million.</p>              <p>UniTrust doesn't do any direct consumer lending.

The difference this time is that the buyers are Chinese, the latest object of domestic anxiety. But the deal will be healthy for both countries if it proves to be an education in the benefits of open world-wide investment.</p>              <p>Smithfield Foods is by far the largest U.S. (and therefore world) hog producer and pork processor, and on Wednesday it announced its friendly acquisition by Shuanghui International. The Hong Kong-based holding company is the majority shareholder of China's largest meat processor, Henan Shuanghui, which is publicly traded and isn't state-owned.</p>              <p>If approved by shareholders and regulators, the $4.7 billion takeover will be the largest to date of an American corporation by a Chinese concern. Shuanghui, which is paying a 31% premium on Smithfield's closing share price on Tuesday, says it plans to keep the company at arm's length and is not replacing CEO Larry Pope or senior management.</p>              <p>On an analyst conference call, Mr. Pope explained that the main benefits for Smithfield are exports and expanding its geographic reach. China's appetite for pork and other high-quality protein has been climbing along with middle-class incomes, though the government has sharply limited foreign access to its food markets. Smithfield will use Shuanghui's distribution system throughout the Middle Kingdom to sell U.S. products.</p>              <p>Shuanghui's Smithfield bid may also do some good if it helps import Western farm and food standards and environmental practices along with Virginia hams. China in recent years has been racked by food-safety scandals, notably thousands of dead and possibly diseased pigs floating down the Whampoa River in March.</p>              <p>As for the politics, this friendly takeover is hardly a candidate for a repeat of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (Cnooc) or Dubai Ports World political irruptions of the Bush years, though Washington protectionists and rural sentimentalists will certainly try. Smithfield isn't a technology company or defense contractor that might implicate national security. U.S. consumers will still be able to buy American-raised pork chops and bacon and will barely notice if dinner is partly financed by Chinese capital.</p>              <p>Opponents may try to perpetrate a mugging through the federal Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius. New York Senator Chuck Schumer and others have been lobbying Cfius to expand its review process beyond national security into a political audit to force China to liberalize its trade policy -- even to the point of scotching 20 China-made turbines on an Oregon wind farm.</p>              <p>Such cases erode U.S. credibility on genuine threats to security and sovereignty, as well as on the larger national interests of free trade and open capital inflows. A better approach is giving Chinese companies a greater stake in the global economy, and in that sense a China-led business integration on the scale of Smithfield is long overdue.</p>              <p>If U.S. politicians still want someone to blame for the acquisition, they might start with themselves. Smithfield has struggled in recent years with its vertical integration model -- farms to meat packing to branded packaged products -- and major shareholders have urged the company to spin off underperforming operations.</p>              <p>Then again, Smithfield has also suffered as government distorts the low-margin livestock business, most notably by diverting corn to fuel via ethanol subsidies and mandates. Roughly two-thirds of the cost of raising a hog is the price of grain, which has surged in recent years. The irony is that if anyone exposed Smithfield to a foreign takeover it is the ethanol lobby and the politicians who bow before it.</p>              <p>(See related letters: ""Letters to the Editor: Will It Be the Year of the Pig in China Going Forward?"" -- WSJ June 6, 2013)</p>                      "

Including debt, the deal values the Smithfield, Va., company at $7.1 billion.</p>              <p>People involved in the deal said Wednesday that the purpose of the tie-up is to export more of Smithfield's output to feed rising demand in China, the world's biggest pork market, and not to import Chinese meat into the U.S.</p>              <p>The proposed deal marks the latest effort by a Chinese company to strike a foreign acquisition aimed at securing access to resources that can drive China's economy -- the world's second largest. In the past, its focus has largely fallen on the mining and oil industries and less on food.</p>              <p>The country and its companies have often been thwarted in their quest to seal such deals -- most notably oil company Cnooc Ltd.'s effort in 2005 to buy Unocal Corp. for $18.5 billion -- amid fears that they could jeopardize U.S. national security and other sensitivities as China becomes the U.S.'s chief global economic rival.</p>              <p>The Smithfield deal is far from guaranteed. In addition to political concerns and fears surrounding Chinese food safety, a rival offer could surface. Smithfield Chairman Joseph Luter said in an interview that other bidders for the company might yet emerge. ""Lots of people love us,"" he said. ""I'll leave it at that.""</p>              <p>Chinese companies have gotten better at navigating the delicate political and regulatory waters in the U.S.</p>              <p>Last year, Chinese buyers agreed to spend $11.57 billion in 49 deals to acquire U.S. companies or stakes in U.S. firms, according to Dealogic. The 2012 dollar volume was higher than the total from 2009 through 2011 combined. And with the Smithfield deal, spending so far this year is stronger than last.</p>              <p>To succeed, many Chinese companies are going after investments of less than $500 million and focusing on private companies or joint ventures. But public companies, such as Smithfield, are also fair game now.</p>              <p>""I'm sure all Chinese companies are watching this deal closely,"" says Robert Profusek, a partner specializing in mergers and acquisitions at Jones Day. ""If it goes through, it might start to change the perspective that the U.S. is not open for business to the Chinese,"" he says.</p>              <p>There were two other companies that were talking to Smithfield around the same time as Shuanghui, according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to name them. Smithfield can now continue to talk to those two suitors, this person said. If one of them strikes a deal with the company in the next 30 days or so, Smithfield could pay a $75 million breakup fee; if such a deal comes later, the fee would be $175 million.</p>              <p>Analysts speculated Wednesday that Brasil Foods SA and Charoen Pokphand Foods Pcl, known as CP Foods, could be suitors for the company.</p>              <p>Spokespeople for Brasil Foods and CP Foods couldn't be reached.</p>              <p>Brazilian food company JBS SA looked at Smithfield, but it never got as far as making a formal offer and doesn't intend to make a counteroffer, said a person familiar with the company's thinking.</p>              <p>Shuanghui's offer was a 31% premium to Smithfield's Tuesday closing price of $25.97 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company's shares jumped 28% to close at $33.35 Wednesday following news of the deal, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.</p>              <p>The U.S. meat industry offers an unusual opportunity for China. It doesn't have the national security concerns of industries such as telecommunications, but it is heavily consolidated among a small number of major players, meaning that any U.S. rivals big enough to bid for Smithfield could face antitrust hurdles.</p>              <p>Smithfield and four other companies control 73% of the U.S. pork-processing industry, according to a Smithfield investor presentation last year. Smithfield owns an array of household names, including Armour, Farmland and Healthy Ones, and gets the vast majority of its sales in the U.S.</p>              <p>China's food and agriculture industry has been racked by health and hygiene scandals in recent years, highlighted in March when thousands of dead pigs were found in rivers around Shanghai. Authorities blamed the problem on irresponsible farmers.</p>              <p>In 2011, Chinese health inspectors discovered clenbuterol -- a food additive banned in China and the U.S. -- in pork products from Henan Shuanghui Investment &amp; Development Co., Shuanghui International's listed unit. Clenbuterol speeds muscle growth in pigs but can cause headaches, nausea and an irregular heartbeat when consumed by humans. The company apologized on its website and said it discontinued partnerships with producers using the contaminant.</p>              <p>Smithfield and Shuanghui said they would submit the deal voluntarily for review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S.</p>              <p>""We really believe this transaction doesn't have any national security concerns,"" Smithfield CEO Larry Pope said in an interview Wednesday. ""In the end, I think CFIUS will see this as a positive, not a negative,"" he said.</p>              <p>Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), the top ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he would urge the Justice Department to ""take a close look at this agreement,"" voicing his concerns that it could lead to higher prices for independent producers of pork and for consumers at the grocery store.</p>              <p>Smithfield's Mr. Pope said the company will contact its customers in coming days to get their reaction to the deal. ""I'm sure there will be concerns from some of our customers,"" he said.</p>              <p>During a conference call with analysts, Mr. Pope stressed that the deal was about exporting more of Smithfield's meat -- to China and elsewhere in Asia -- and not importing Chinese pork. Currently, about 25% of Smithfield's exports are to China.</p>              <p>The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents about 16,000 Smithfield employees, signaled its support for the deal, saying in a statement that it was ""pleased"" that current Smithfield management would stay in place and that all collective bargaining agreements would remain in place.</p>              <p>Shuanghui, also known as Shineway and based in Henan province in central China, is the majority shareholder of China's largest meat processor, Henan Shuanghui, which is publicly listed in the Chinese city of Shenzhen. Unlike other Chinese companies that have loomed large on the world stage in recent years, Shuanghui isn't state-controlled.</p>              <p>Shuanghui chairman Wan Long is sometimes called ""China's No. 1 Butcher"" in the media because of the company's statements that it slaughters more than 15 million pigs a year.</p>              <p>Like many of China's top business leaders, Mr. Wan has cultivated political connections in Beijing. For the past 15 years he has been a member of China's National People's Congress, a national-level rubber-stamp legislature that meets once a year to formalize measures proposed by leaders of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>              <p>Shuanghui gets much of its products from private farmers. The practice has come under scrutiny in China amid a spate of food scandals in which poorly regulated small farms played a role.</p>              <p>In interviews, Mr. Wan has said he wants to increase the amount of pigs that come from company-owned farms.</p>              <p>In the news release confirming the deal, the companies stressed they would ""retain world-leading food safety and quality control standards.""</p>              <p>The deal comes on the heels of agitation from a large Smithfield shareholder, Continental Grain Co., to split the company up.</p>              <p>Continental Grain, which together with several related parties recently owned roughly 6% of Smithfield, has said the board should consider separating into three businesses: hog production; fresh pork and packaged-meats production; and international pork operations. Smithfield says it disagrees with Continental's recommendations.</p>              <p>Continental has urged Smithfield to add three new directors to its board, among other suggestions, and its deadline for filing a slate of directors is this week.</p>              <p>Mr. Pope said in the interview that he has had a relationship with Shuanghui since long before Continental started pushing for change.</p>              <p>Mr. Pope said on the conference call that Smithfield first broached the idea of a deal with Shuanghui about four years ago and has had discussions with the Chinese company since then, but ""pricing has always been an issue.""</p>              <p>Mr. Pope, a longtime Smithfield executive, became CEO in 2006, filling the shoes of the company's longtime leader, Mr. Luter, who was the architect of its strategy to become vertically integrated, snapping up hog farms along with its pork-processing plants.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Cameron McWhirter, Shangguan Zhoudong, William Mauldin, David Benoit and Corey Boles contributed to this article.</p>              <p>Credit: By Dana Mattioli, Dana Cimilluca and David Kesmodel</p>                      "

A Marketplace article Friday about purchases of overseas brands by Chinese companies incorrectly said AMC's shares have risen about 70% since Dalian Wanda purchased the business last year.</p>              <p>(WSJ June 3, 2013)</p>              <p>SHANGHAI -- China already owns ThinkPad laptops, Volvo cars and AMC movie theaters. Can it sell Smithfield Ham?</p>              <p>A look at past Chinese purchases suggests that the answer is likely, ""Yes."" Chinese companies have stumbled in efforts to build homegrown brands in areas ranging from autos to tennis shoes. But with a few hitches -- notably Volvo's in the sputtering European car market -- the companies have managed to keep existing global brands healthy by investing and persuading senior managers to stay on board.</p>              <p>""There has been initial concern about quality when foreign companies have been acquired by companies in developing markets, but the concerns fade over time,"" said Jon Parker, a mergers-and-acquisitions partner at KPMG China. Many Chinese companies are able to expand foreign brands while leveraging their own manufacturing strengths, streamlining costs and production, he said.</p>              <p>That track record offers a positive sign for Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd. On Wednesday it unveiled a $4.7 billion deal to acquire Smithfield Foods Inc., which supplies U.S. supermarkets with Smithfield Ham, Eckrich sausages, Armour meatballs and Farmland bacon. Shuanghui has stressed that it will keep senior management in place.</p>              <p>If completed, the deal would be the largest Chinese purchase of a U.S. company. More deals from China are expected in the second half, with the U.S., Canada, Australia and the European Union as targets, according to KPMG. There were an estimated 40 deals completed last year between Chinese companies and the U.S., valued at $11.1 billion, the firm said.</p>              <p>Chinese companies have also purchased Ferretti Italian luxury yachts; Weetabix cereal, a staple of British breakfast tables; and the U.K. company that makes London's famous black cabs. The deals have been motivated in part by Beijing's desire for its companies to gain global footprints and to nurture China's consumer class.</p>              <p>The strategy for many Chinese companies looking to create global reputations has been to buy strong, sizable brands that already have power, rather than attempt to build Chinese brands and businesses, said Doreen Wang, head of client solutions at brand-research company Millward Brown in Beijing. ""Acquiring or creating joint ventures leverages both Chinese and foreign companies,"" she said, allowing the opportunity for ""building the brand in a more systematic way than starting from ground zero.""</p>              <p>Indigenous Chinese brands have struggled. Companies such as Li Ning Co., which once aspired to be a major global sports-apparel brand, haven't been able to compete successfully with international rivals. Among the world's top 10 most valuable brands as measured by Millward Brown, only one is Chinese. And that company, state-controlled telecommunications operator China Mobile Ltd., is firmly China-focused.</p>              <p>Perhaps China's biggest foreign-brand success story is Lenovo Group Ltd., which in 2005 bought the personal-computer business of International Business Machines Corp. and with it, ThinkPad laptops. At first the business posted losses and struggled with integration, fulfilling the expectations of analysts who had questioned whether a Chinese company would damage a brand that IBM had built by selling to corporate clients.</p>              <p>But Lenovo kept several key managers, including Arimasa Naitoh, the engineer who designed the ThinkPad, inspired by a Japanese lunchbox. Lenovo also split its headquarters between Beijing and Morrisville, N.C., where the IBM unit had been based, and made English the company's official language. Lenovo Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing also expanded in developing markets, particularly China, where PC demand continued to boom.</p>              <p>Since Lenovo took over, ThinkPad sales have doubled, while profit margins have remained above 5%. The company also is gaining market share as rivals such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Inc. take hits from the rise of tablets like Apple Inc.'s iPad. ""To have higher market share, you need to have a brand,"" Mr. Yang said last year.</p>              <p>Since Chinese car maker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. bought Volvo in 2010, the line has taken a hit because of economic woes in Europe, its key market. Volvo's global sales fell 6.1% last year, and the Swedish car maker barely eked out an operating profit. Volvo is betting on an $11 billion product redesign and its China business.</p>              <p>Geely has been careful to stress Volvo's independence. At the same time, the Chinese parent has helped expedite approval for Volvo's soon-to-open plant in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu and is looking to tap Geely's local expertise and supplier connections.</p>              <p>Results in China have been disappointing. Sales declined to 41,989 cars last year from 47,140 a year earlier -- way behind rivals such as Audi and BMW. But in the first four months of this year, Volvo sold 18,490 cars in China, up 28% from a year earlier. In April, China became Volvo's largest single market.</p>              <p>Other deals have had more success. Since last May, just after Chinese property conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group Corp. announced its $2.6 billion purchase of U.S. movie chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., the theater chain AMC's stock has risen about 70%. AMC last year posted a profit of $58 million on revenue that increased 11% to $2.65 billion.

"59","2013-06-20","Rethinking That Chinese Pork Takeover","1369651566","Wall Street Journal","A.21","            >                             </title>            >                          <p>After weeks of speculation about whether Washington would oppose the acquisition by a Chinese company of America's largest pork producer, a challenge to the deal is emerging from another quarter -- the market. Starboard Value LP, a fund that owns 5.7% of Smithfield Foods' shares, said in a June 17 letter to Smithfield's board that the $4.7 billion Chinese bid ""significantly understates"" the company's value. The stage is set for a useful learning experience for a Chinese buyer.</p>              <p>How best to maximize the value of the target company is not a hill that previous Chinese buyers were accustomed to fighting on. Deals such as Cnooc's attempt at Unocal in 2005 bogged down in controversy over national-security concerns. Far less often -- if ever -- has an investor actually challenged the business rationale for such a purchase as Starboard may do now.</p>              <p>The immense premiums that Chinese acquirers pay have something to do with it. The 60% Cnooc paid above the pre-deal share price for Canada's Nexen last year, for example, discouraged shareholder complaints -- and interest from other prospective purchasers. China's Shuanghui International may have thought the 31% premium it offered over Smithfield's pre-deal share price would have a similar effect.</p>              <p>Apparently that premium can't quiet the nagging questions about whether this acquisition makes sense for anyone concerned. Shuanghui, a major pork producer with a history of safety scares, clearly hopes to absorb Smithfield's techniques for running a successful pork producer with a quality brand image. Of particular interest to China is that Smithfield is a large, vertically integrated food producer, growing the hogs it slaughters and processes. That makes it the kind of company Beijing appears to want to conjure out of the caldron of China's own highly fragmented agriculture.</p>              <p>Yet Smithfield's advantages are overstated. It isn't obvious that vertical integration leads to noticeable food-safety improvements. Smithfield's U.S. competitors don't operate on this model and have similarly good safety records. Smithfield itself only raises about half of the pigs it turns into pork loins and bacon, buying the rest from smaller farmers almost always without incident.</p>              <p>The safety of American food traces instead to the structure of the American economy -- with strong brands creating the right incentives all along supply chains, transparent regulations that are well enforced, and rule of law compensating victims of lapses. A question for Beijing would be whether Smithfield or any other American food company would operate as safely had it not emerged from such a system.</p>              <p>Even Western companies have fumbled in China. Sanlu, the Chinese dairy at the center of the 2008 milk-powder contamination case, was part-owned by New Zealand's Fonterra, which otherwise boasts an excellent safety record.</p>              <p>Meanwhile, it isn't clear that Smithfield has been a particularly successful business. What China perceives to be Smithfield's greatest asset, its vertical integration, could instead be its greatest weakness. The company's then largest shareholder said as much barely a month before the Chinese acquisition was announced, when it launched a campaign to force management to break the company into parts.</p>              <p>Continental Grain, which at the time owned roughly 6% of Smithfield's shares, suggested that the hog-raising part of the company ought to be hived off. Hog-raising profits are volatile and drag on the profits from meatpacking. Continental's was one possible answer to the central challenge facing Smithfield: how to maintain profitability as Washington's quixotic green-energy policies divert corn to ethanol production from feed, making it more expensive to fatten a porker.</p>              <p>Faced with intransigent management, Continental Grain eventually gave up, taking advantage of the steep increase in Smithfield's share price after the Chinese offer to exit its investment. But now comes new investor Starboard Value to make more or less the same point. The fund is undeterred by Shuanghui's rich offer, $7.1 billion including debt. It suggests that a corporate split would unlock as much as $10.8 billion in shareholder value. That would work out to $55 per share, compared with Shuanghui's $34 per share offer.</p>              <p>Starboard could well be wrong. But at a minimum its gambit will send Smithfield investors back to their spreadsheets. It also raises a question for Shuanghui: If Starboard Value is right, the Chinese company will be shelling out billions of dollars for a company with know-how of questionable value and a problem -- ethanol -- that China doesn't have a clue how to solve. A cheap price is only a good deal if you know how to increase the value of your investment.</p>              <p>And if the current offer is a fair reflection of the company's value, how exactly is Shuanghui sure about that? It would be helpful if the company articulated a clear business case to Smithfield's shareholders why its offer is the best return they can realistically expect. Which means Shuanghui will have to develop such an argument.</p>              <p>Chinese acquirers aren't accustomed to facing such questions. If one of the purposes of encouraging those firms to buy overseas is pedagogical, then this lesson comes not a moment too soon.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Mr. Sternberg edits the Business Asia column.</p>              <p>Credit: By Joseph Sternberg</p>                      "

The global trading unit, centered in Hong Kong, will seek to expand sales of Smithfield's pork in China and other markets by leveraging Shuanghui's distribution network, executives said.</p>              <p>""For this acquisition, we have one guiding principle: to accelerate Smithfield's global expansion,"" Wan Long, the 73-year-old chairman of Shuanghui, said in a joint interview with executives from the two companies this week. ""We will provide better organization and distribution of Smithfield's products to all parts of the world.""</p>              <p>Hong Kong-based Shuanghui plans to unveil details in a few weeks of new, premium pork products targeted at China's growing middle class and made of meat produced in the U.S. This demographic ""has a huge demand for healthy, high-quality food,"" said Zhijun Yang, Shuanghui's chief executive.</p>              <p>The takeover unites China's largest pork processor with the world's largest hog farmer and pork processor, creating a new global leader in pork production with combined annual revenue of nearly $20 billion. Virginia-based Smithfield, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Shuanghui, embraced the deal because China, the world's biggest pork market, presented the company's best avenue for growth after years of sluggish U.S. sales.</p>              <p>The acquisition's closing caps months of debate over the implications for U.S. food safety and the deal's fairness given China's limits on foreign investment in many of its industries. The integration of the two companies will be closely watched amid speculation the merger could spark other major food and agriculture deals between the U.S. and China.</p>              <p>Executives reiterated Shuanghui has no plans to export pork from China to the U.S., in part because it costs considerably more to produce pork in China than in the U.S., where feed costs are lower due to the abundance of corn -- a major expense in raising hogs.</p>              <p>Mr. Wan said Shuanghui will gain technical experience, improved food-safety practices and become more efficient. He said Smithfield's workers currently are much more productive than Shuanghui's.</p>              <p>Larry Pope, who will remain Smithfield's CEO, said during the joint interview in New York that the acquisition will benefit Smithfield and U.S. hog farmers. For instance, Smithfield will ship more hams, shoulder meat and other muscle cuts to China. Most pork shipped to the Asian nation has consisted of pig feet, stomachs and other cuts that Americans typically don't consume, he said.</p>              <p>""We have the opportunity to sell those cuts deep into [China] and access their customers with our products,"" Mr. Pope said.</p>              <p>Shuanghui executives said they also planned to increase sales of Smithfield pork to Japan, Australia, South Korea and Europe. They declined to provide specific sales targets.</p>              <p>To boost export sales, employees of each company's export-sales office -- Smithfield's is based in Kansas City, Mo., while Shuanghui's is in Hong Kong -- have begun coordinating on strategy.</p>              <p>China accounts for about a quarter of Smithfield's pork exports in terms of volume, and shipments to the country rose 15% in the fiscal year that began in April compared with a year earlier, a Smithfield spokeswoman said.</p>              <p>The three executives demonstrated an easy rapport in the joint interview, despite a big language gap. Mr. Pope, 59, said he's working on that, but that Mr. Yang, 39, is ""studying English more than I'm studying Chinese.""</p>              <p>The executives acknowledged one of their biggest challenges will be to integrate two vastly different corporate cultures. Such combinations have proven difficult. For instance, Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group Ltd. faced strains after it bought International Business Machines Corp.'s PC operations in the mid-2000s.</p>              <p>""It's going to have its bumps,"" Mr. Pope said. ""Our cultures are different. We don't speak the same. But we have the same vision.""</p>              <p>Messrs.

And some wealthy shoppers are coming to browse.</p>              <p>Famous for its sexpot designs and celebrity clients, Versace is trying to sell an up to 20% slice to investors to bring in much-needed cash and close the revenue gap that opened with rivals after the murder of its founding designer, Gianni Versace, in 1997.</p>              <p>The deal is drawing interest from some heavyweight funds -- the latest being Blackstone Group LP and KKR &amp; Co., according to people familiar with the matter.</p>              <p>Versace's investment bankers will draw up a short list of candidates by next week, these people said. Other likely bidders include Permira Advisers Holdings Ltd., Italian private-equity fund Clessidra and French fund Ardian. The firms either declined to comment or didn't respond to requests.</p>              <p>The current owners, the late Mr. Versace's sister Donatella and brother Santo, and his niece Allegra, have set the bar high. In exchange for an investment of about 250 million euros ($338 million), a new investor must accept management's current strategy and have no say on the design direction.</p>              <p>Some funds have shunned the auction. Chinese fund Fosun International Ltd. has decided not to pursue it, while L Capital, the private-equity arm of French fashion giant LVMH Louis Vuitton-Moet Hennessy SA, examined the pitch, but decided not to bid, a person familiar with the matter said. The he strongest bidder could be Fondo Strategico Italiano, an Italian investment vehicle that typically doesn't get involved in day-to-day management, these people said.</p>              <p>""We have a potential gold mine in Versace,"" Chief Executive Gian Giacomo Ferraris said in an interview. ""It was all there in Versace, but it was overshadowed.""</p>              <p>The strong performance of fashion IPOs such as Salvatore Ferragamo SpA has raised interest in a stake, say executives at some of the funds. But if the Versaces don't feel comfortable with the candidates or if the valuation was below 1 billion euros, they could scrap plans to sell a stake altogether.</p>              <p>Until recently, Versace's bumpy performance made it a tough sell. After Mr. Versace died, it struggled under the design direction of his sister, Donatella. The company teetered on the brink of bankruptcy in 2004, when creditors moved in and demanded wholesale change in management.</p>              <p>Versace has hit its stride under Mr. Ferraris's management. He has pushed sales up 50% and achieved its first operating profit since 2009. Last year, Versace had an operating profit of 45 million euros on revenues of 409 million euros.</p>              <p>And the company has room to grow, said Mr. Ferraris. Unlike many luxury companies, it relies largely on clothing, rather than accessories, which are easier to sell and are more profitable. The house's leather goods division is still small -- it has yet to produce a hit bag -- yet the revenues have risen 30% over the last three years.</p>              <p>The focus on ready-to-wear ""is a rarity,"" said Stefania Saviolo, a fashion management professor at Bocconi University in Milan. ""At many other big fashion houses, the biggest stake of revenue comes from accessories, which have much higher margins.""</p>              <p>The brand also has a smaller retail footprint than rivals. It had 114 directly operated stores at the end of 2012, up from 76 in 2009, but below the 461 controlled by Prada SpA.</p>              <p>While money from the sale of a stake could fuel retail expansion, Versace may face a challenge in convincing more department stores to carry the line, given that Versace designs' bold colors and slinky fit aren't for the faint of heart.</p>              <p>""Versace has an amazing heritage and a very defined position, but because of its core values -- aggressive, strong -- many people reject it even before seeing it,"" said Ron Frasch, president and chief merchant at Saks.</p>              <p>Credit: By Manuela Mesco</p>                      "

It would again highlight the desire of companies in the world's second-largest economy to become bigger players in the West, where they stand to gain both industrial expertise and a wider array of products to sell their customers.</p>              <p>Just last month, Chinese pork giant Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd. completed its purchase of Smithfield Foods Inc. for $4.7 billion, the biggest ever acquisition of a U.S. firm by a Chinese company.</p>              <p>Lenovo, a late comer to the smartphone market, has gained traction in its home market and now ships more smartphones than BlackBerry. In the second quarter, Lenovo accounted for 4.7% of global smartphone sales, according to research firm Gartner, while BlackBerry's share fell to 2.7%.</p>              <p>Should Lenovo follow through and succeed with a binding offer for BlackBerry -- still a big if -- the proposed deal would be certain to face government scrutiny in both Canada and the U.S.</p>              <p>Bids for BlackBerry, which is based in Waterloo, Ontario, are expected to come in by Nov. 4, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>              <p>BlackBerry accounts for about 470,000 of the 600,000 mobile devices owned and issued by the Defense Department, according to a Pentagon spokesman. In all, more than a million BlackBerry devices were in use by U.S. federal and state employees as of the end of last year, according to the company. President Barack Obama is among those users.</p>              <p>The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. would likely review any proposed purchase of BlackBerry by Lenovo. Cfius, an interagency panel, focuses solely on national-security risks. The Treasury, which leads the committee, doesn't comment on cases under review.</p>              <p>A spokeswoman for Canadian Industry Minister James Moore, the official responsible for approving any foreign-led bid that might emerge for BlackBerry, said Canada's government is aware that the company is exploring a sale, but she declined to comment on the process.</p>              <p>In Washington, Lenovo is a known quantity. In 2005 it bought International Business Machines Corp.'s PC business for $1.25 billion -- at the time one of the biggest foreign acquisitions ever by a Chinese company -- with relatively little fanfare. Back then, IBM PCs were widely used by U.S. government officials, just as BlackBerry devices are today. Lenovo has since completed several smaller deals that would have likely required U.S. approval.</p>              <p>The company opened a manufacturing plant in North Carolina in June, and more than a third of its top dozen officials are Westerners, according to its website.</p>              <p>BlackBerry might be willing to put up with some political noise and a lengthy review process to be rewarded with a higher price, said Jeff Bialos, a former U.S. deputy undersecretary of defense who now practices law in Washington. ""All things being equal, [BlackBerry] would rather sell to a North American buyer,"" said Mr. Bialos, who isn't involved in the company's auction. ""You go to China for the premium.""</p>              <p>Canada requires any foreign bid for a Canadian company exceeding 344 million Canadian dollars (US$334 million) to pass a government review to determine whether it is a ""net economic benefit"" or a security risk to the country.</p>              <p>Canada's Conservative government has rejected three proposed foreign takeovers of Canadian assets since coming to power in early 2006.</p>              <p>Last week, in a surprise announcement, the country rejected a deal led by Egyptian telecom entrepreneur Naguib Sawiris to buy a division of Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., citing national-security concerns. That division is arguably less strategically important to Canada's government than BlackBerry, whose smartphones are widely used by officials there.</p>              <p>Last December, Canada gave the green light to the $15.1 billion takeover of Canadian oil-sands company Nexen Inc. by Cnooc Ltd., a Chinese state-owned enterprise. But the government signaled that any further deals for Canadian oil-sands assets led by Chinese state-owned companies would be approved only under ""exceptional"" circumstances, as further foreign-government involvement in that sector was no longer a ""net benefit"" to Canada's economy.</p>              <p>Lenovo would have some competition for BlackBerry, which in August officially put itself on the block after years of ceding smartphone market share to rivals including Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.</p>              <p>Last month, BlackBerry reached a preliminary $4.7 billion buyout deal with Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., a Canadian insurance firm that is one of tge company's largest shareholders.</p>              <p>Others that have been considering BlackBerry bids include Cerberus Capital Management LP, which has also signed a non-disclosure agreement to look at the books, according to a person familiar with the matter, and BlackBerry co-founders Mike Lazaridis and Doug Fregin, who recently disclosed their interest in a public filing.</p>              <p>In 4 p.m. Nasdaq trading Thursday, BlackBerry shares were up 7 cents at $8.20.

Both Lenovo and BlackBerry have declined to comment.</p>              <p>A spokesman for Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper declined to speculate Friday about possible bidders for BlackBerry. He added, though, that the government does welcome foreign investment in Canada, ""but not at the expense of our national security.""</p>              <p>BlackBerry officially put itself up for sale in August after a new line of phones failed to gain ground against rivals like Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Corp. Last month, it reached a preliminary $4.7 billion buyout deal with Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., a Canadian insurance firm and one of its largest shareholders. Other parties are considering bids, including Cerberus Capital Management LP, which like Lenovo has signed a nondisclosure agreement to look at BlackBerry's books, according to a person familiar with the matter, and BlackBerry co-founders Mike Lazaridis and Doug Fregin, who recently disclosed their interest in a public filing.</p>              <p>Recent sizable Canadian acquisitions by foreign companies suggest that Lenovo might have to make firm commitments around job protection and research and development spending, or pledge to seek a listing on a Canadian exchange, in order to get a green light from Ottawa.</p>              <p>In clinching approval for its $15.1 billion acquisition of Canadian energy firm Nexen Inc. last year, Chinese energy giant Cnooc Ltd. made several promises to the Canadian government, mostly around corporate transparency and investing in the country's oil and gas sector. It also committed to making Calgary, Alberta the base for its North and Central American operations, retaining Nexen employees, and listing its shares on Canada's flagship Toronto Stock Exchange.</p>              <p>Before BlackBerry came to prominence, Nortel Networks Corp. was Canada's technology icon until its business collapsed, forcing the telecom-equipment provider to seek bankruptcy protection in 2009 and to auction off its assets. That process sparked debate in Canada over the potential loss of valuable research and development and patents, particularly after Sweden's Ericsson bought Nortel's wireless-network business for about $1.1 billion. In the end, the Canadian government didn't review that acquisition because the assets' book value was deemed to fall below the review threshold in Investment Canada Act, a measure that says a takeover has to be of ""net benefit"" to Canada in order to be passed.</p>              <p>Still, to garner support for the deal, Ericsson promised jobs to at least 80% of the 3,100 employees at Nortel's wireless unit.</p>              <p>Canada hasn't always been swayed by these types of commitments. In 2010, Anglo-Australian mining giant BHP Billiton Ltd. offered to center its global potash business in Canada to win support for its $39 billion bid for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan. But amid stiff opposition from leaders in the company's home province of Saskatchewan, the government blocked the deal.</p>              <p>Meanwhile, in Washington the deal would likely also face serious hurdles because U.S. government personnel rely so heavily on BlackBerry service, according to experts familiar with the approval process.</p>              <p>BlackBerry's large presence in the U.S. would make such a deal subject to approval by the Committee for Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, a powerful government panel that focuses exclusively on national security risks, according to lawyers and experts who have worked with the committee.</p>              <p>Chinese technology companies have a checkered history with the U.S. government, with members of the intelligence community singling out individual companies as security risks.

What brings them together is the dream of an enormous bounty from the field, called Vaca Muerta, or Dead Cow. </p>              <p>President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's decision to press ahead with the partnership with Chevron has her critics and supporters fuming because of the company's long conflict with Ecuador over an Amazon pollution case. Other legal battles are raging over Argentina's nationalization of its largest oil company, which also threaten to entangle Chevron.</p>              <p>And protests against hydraulic fracturing, the high pressure blasting of water and chemicals through the shale fields here in the Patagonian desert, have grown so fierce that the police have cracked down on thousands of demonstrators with tear gas and rubber bullets. Though Chevron is not directly involved in the fracturing, the popular agitation over the company's venture here may subject other energy initiatives in this remote region to greater scrutiny. </p>              <p>Mrs. Kirchner's embrace of Chevron is a striking demonstration of the lengths to which some governments, desperate for money, and energy companies, combing the world for new sources of oil, will go to emulate the shale oil revolution in the United States. </p>              <p>And few fields offer the potential riches of Vaca Muerta, which has estimated oil and gas reserves nearly equal to the total reserves of the oil giant Exxon Mobil.</p>              <p>""There is nothing close to this in the world,"" Ali Moshiri, president of Chevron's Africa-Latin America Exploration and Production, said of Vaca Muerta in an interview. ""In our business risk is part of the equation.""</p>              <p>Even with her health in doubt, after surgery this month to drain a blood clot that resulted from a head injury, Mrs. Kirchner has shown that she is willing to turn her back on years of economic policies that discouraged some energy investments. In the process, she is testing relations with her Ecuadorean ally, President Rafael Correa, who is trying to get Chevron to pay $19 billion in damages related to oil pollution in the Amazon rain forest.</p>              <p>Chevron's assets in Argentina were frozen for months last year as the Ecuadorean plaintiffs in the case began increasing pressure on the company outside Ecuador. Chevron not only continued to operate in Argentina after that initial scare, but also opted to aggressively expand here, reflecting a vital need by big oil companies to find new oil reserves even in the most politically unstable places.</p>              <p>The United States Energy Information Administration has ranked Argentina fourth behind Russia, the United States and China in the world, with technically recoverable shale oil reserves of 27 billion barrels. And it ranks Argentina second after China in potentially recoverable shale gas reserves, with 802 trillion cubic feet. But as in many countries outside the United States, shale development in Argentina had progressed at a snail's pace until now because of resistance and regulatory uncertainty. Local opposition among environmentalists and Mapuche Indians remains fierce.</p>              <p>""This is the worst form of extracting oil by the company with the worst record,"" said Enrique Viale, the president of the Argentina Association of Environmental Lawyers, who took part in a protest of thousands against the agreement with Chevron in August when legislators were voting on it. Some buildings in Buenos Aires, the capital, remain covered in anti-Chevron graffiti. A rap video on social media in Argentina excoriates the authorities for working with Chevron.</p>              <p>Despite all the friction, Chevron took the leap a year ago with a tentative partnership agreement with YPF, the Argentine oil company that is now controlled by the government, to help develop part of Vaca Muerta. In control of a third of the field, YPF is also preparing agreements with several other companies including Bridas Corporation, a venture including the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, or Cnooc.</p>              <p>Chevron initially plans to invest $1.24 billion for the drilling of more than 100 wells, and if all goes well, the Chevron-YPF venture would drill an additional 1,500 wells by 2017, requiring more than $17 billion in investment. That could raise production to 50,000 barrels of oil and three million cubic meters of gas a day over 35 years.</p>              <p>Few companies have had the moxie to wager so much since Argentina defaulted on its $81 billion sovereign debt in 2001. President Kirchner renationalized YPF last year, and has yet to compensate the Spanish oil company Repsol any money for its controlling interest, which Repsol says was worth $10.5 billion.</p>              <p>Pointing to these challenges, Miguel Galuccio, the chief executive of YPF, insisted in an interview that the future of Argentina's economy depends on YPF's ability to develop the nation's shale oil resources.</p>              <p>Surprising critics of Mrs. Kirchner who expected her to politicize YPF, as her government had done with other state-controlled companies, Mr. Galuccio seems to have taken a different approach. He has hired respected managers and petroleum engineers, many of them Argentines who were living abroad, to fill YPF's top ranks. And he has begun to reverse a decline in YPF's production, repositioning the company to focus on fracturing in Neuquén which he argues will not jeopardize local water supplies.</p>              <p>In the interview, he lauded Chevron for its partnership with YPF, saying he was well aware of the risks, including Chevron's legal battles in Ecuador, which persist. ""This brings a level of complexity I'd like not to have,"" he said. ""We need more Chevrons in Argentina.""</p>              <p>Facing a potential financial crisis, the Argentine government reversed course on energy policy in recent months as it has often done in the past.</p>              <p>It is now allowing companies to sell gas at a higher fixed price, and in a move especially for Chevron, Mrs. Kirchner recently issued a decree allowing oil and gas companies to sell 20 percent of their production abroad without paying export taxes or obligations to repatriate profits -- as long as they invest more than $1 billion in the country.</p>              <p>Still, Chevron faces enduring problems in Argentina, highlighted by pressure from the country's most influential journalist, Jorge Lanata, an outspoken critic of Mrs. Kirchner who has been attacking Chevron's record in Ecuador.</p>              <p>Soon after Chevron and YPF signed their initial deal in 2012, two lower courts threatened the arrangement by freezing part of Chevron Argentina's assets in the country so they might eventually be sold to pay the Ecuadoreans who are suing Chevron.</p>              <p>Lawyers representing Ecuadorean Amazon Indians won a judgment in a local Ecuadorean court ordering Chevron to pay more than $18 billion in damages for the dumping of toxic waste into a vast area of Amazon jungle by Texaco in the 1970s before it was acquired by Chevron years later. (Chevron insists that Texaco cleaned up its area of operations and subsequent pollution was caused by PetroEcuador, the state company that once partnered with Texaco.)</p>              <p>Since Chevron has no assets in Ecuador, the plaintiffs are trying to collect on the judgment in Canada, Brazil and Argentina, where Chevron subsidiaries have significant holdings.</p>              <p>When the case reached the Argentine Supreme Court, Mrs. Kirchner threw her support behind Chevron despite the lobbying of President Correa of Ecuador, an ally who has publicly declared that the oil company is an enemy of his country. Her attorney general filed a brief with the court arguing that the Ecuadorean judgment could not be enforced against Chevron Argentina since the subsidiary could not defend itself in the Ecuadorean proceeding, warning that the Supreme Court needed to act to avoid ""irreparable and irreversible harm to essential national interests.""</p>              <p>The Supreme Court agreed with the government in a June decision, opening the way to the final Chevron-YPF agreement signing in July. But lawyers for the Ecuadorean Indians say they are not finished in Argentina.</p>              <p>The lawyers said that the Supreme Court decision was merely a technical problem that could easily be corrected by returning to the Ecuadorean courts in the coming months to file a petition seeking to execute the original judgment against Chevron Argentina and possibly other foreign subsidiaries. Once they succeed, they say, they will demand that Argentine courts accept the Ecuadorean judgment under reciprocal legal treaties.</p>              <p>""I am certain the case is still alive in Argentina, of course,"" said Pablo Fajardo, the lead Ecuadorean lawyer. ""I believe the Supreme Court in Argentina made a mistake and should correct it. I have confidence in their judges.""</p>              <p>Kent Robertson, a Chevron spokesman, responded: ""They have demonstrated they can get whatever they want in Ecuador. It doesn't mean they can collect. There has been no trial against Chevron Argentina.""</p>              <p>Argentine oil officials said that the Chevron-YPF deal will shield the American company from financial loss connected to a change in the political winds. After the company invests $1.2 billion, 18 months later it can withdraw from operations without penalty and continue to receive net profits of 50 percent of the production from the initial wells in perpetuity. </p>              <p>Mr. Moshiri of Chevron said he was not focused on the Ecuador case. ""That's a separate issue unrelated to what we are doing in Argentina and in the Vaca Muerta,"" he said. ""We are just going to continue with our business. Chevron Argentina has nothing to do with it.""</p>              <p>Still, the legal battle is just one of the obstacles that both companies face. </p>              <p>""We'll continue our fight to defend the land, the water and the air,"" said Lefxaru Nahuel, 26, a Mapuche in Patagonia who has been leading protests.

But Facebook would have to resurrect a damaged brand that has largely failed in the marketplace this year.</p>              <p>The social network could attempt to build its own phone using BlackBerry's assets and patents, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has publicly denied such a move, calling it the ""wrong strategy.""</p>              <p>Last month, BlackBerry struck a preliminary deal to go private with Canadian insurer Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. for $4.7 billion.

And unlike a spate of purchases in the 1980s, when Japanese electronics company Sony Corp. took on Hollywood by purchasing Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., Asian buyers have avoided touchy areas and thus, a backlash from American consumers.</p>              <p>""We have not seen such a strong phenomenon of Asian firms buying U.S. brands before. I believe we will see more multibillion-dollar outbound M&amp;As by Asian companies this year,"" said Lian Lian, a co-head of North Asia mergers and acquisitions at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. The sluggishness of the global economic recovery may ""encourage Western firms to rationalize value expectations"" and sell assets, she said.</p>              <p>Japan's Suntory Holdings Ltd. said Monday it would buy Beam for $13.6 billion -- less than a year after SoftBank Corp. purchased Sprint for $21.6 billion. The deals are part of a drive by Japanese companies -- struggling with an aging population and slow growth at home -- to strengthen their offerings and boost their popularity overseas. In the SoftBank deal, Sprint received cash to help it compete with bigger rivals in the U.S., one of the world's most lucrative markets for smartphones.</p>              <p>""In some ways, Suntory going for Beam is not a surprise,"" said Jeremy Cunnington, an analyst at Euromonitor International in London. ""The company, along with its fellow Japanese companies, has been looking to diversify away from its moribund markets. And undoubtedly, Beam's array of international brands would make it a truly global spirits player."" The deal will vault Suntory to the world's sixth-largest spirits company by volume from 25th, Mr. Cunnington said.</p>              <p>While Japanese companies have been pushing to gain access to overseas markets, their Chinese counterparts have been making purchases to bring brands home.</p>              <p>Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd. last year bought Smithfield Foods for $4.7 billion, the largest purchase by a Chinese company of a U.S. one. Shuanghui's purchase gave it a well-respected brand that Shuanghui can take home to China -- the world's largest pork consumer -- as food scandals and increasing urbanization drive demand for a safe, secure food supply.</p>              <p>Shuanghui's deal stood in contrast to a 2005 attempt by oil company Cnooc Ltd. to buy Unocal Corp. for $18.5 billion, which was thwarted by fears for U.S. national security.</p>              <p>Asian companies bought $260 billion in U.S. assets in the five years since 2009, above the $206 billion purchased in the previous five years, according to Dealogic.</p>              <p>The SoftBank and Suntory acquisitions are bigger than the Asian -- primarily Japanese -- acquisitions of U.S. assets made in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p>              <p>Until the SoftBank deal, the biggest Asian purchase of a U.S. asset was Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp.'s $9.8 billion acquisition of a 16% stake in AT&amp;T Wireless Group Inc. in 2000. Excluding financial services, the next-biggest Asian purchase of a U.S. company was Takeda's $8.1 billion purchase of Millennium in 2008, trailed by Japan Tobacco Inc.'s $7.8 billion purchase in 1999 of the international tobacco operations of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.

China's Lenovo Group Ltd. is also considering a purchase of the business, another person said. Such machines produce the overall server market's highest volumes but lowest profit margin, analysts say.</p>              <p>The market for x86 servers, named for the chip design used by Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., grew quickly in the 1990s as the Internet took off and data centers powered by servers the size of pizza boxes proliferated.</p>              <p>But technological advances in the last decade such as ""virtualization"" allowed users to squeeze more power out of fewer machines. In recent years, the acceleration of cloud computing has led companies to rent computing resources more often, which has cut into server sales.</p>              <p>Another buzzkill: Some large Internet companies such as Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. that had purchased x86 servers to power their websites now make their own machines. Internet companies say the stripped-down machines are less expensive and more efficient at routing data.</p>              <p>IBM last spring was in advanced discussions to sell all or part of its x86 server business to Lenovo, but the talks broke down over price. Lenovo, which put out a statement Tuesday in China saying it's ""in preliminary negotiations with a third party"" it didn't name over a possible acquisition, then put the value of the operation at below $2.5 billion. It's unclear what price any of the possible buyers is currently discussing.</p>              <p>Low-end servers had churned out double-digit revenue gains, but their growth has slowed in the past few years. IBM doesn't break out revenue in dollar terms for its x86 server unit.</p>              <p>Morgan Stanley estimated that the business generated about $4.9 billion of IBM's $15.4 billion in overall server sales in 2012.</p>              <p>The unit's revenue has dropped for six consecutive quarters, and the declines have accelerated since the Lenovo talks leaked. IBM reported that third-quarter revenue from low-end servers declined 18% from a year earlier, following a second-quarter drop of 11%.</p>              <p>The overall x86 server market grew 2.1% in unit terms in the third quarter and grew 4.4% by revenue, according to research firm Gartner.</p>              <p>A sale would fit IBM's strategy of moving upstream in the industry. Over the last decade, IBM has exited low-margin businesses such as personal computers -- an operation it sold to Lenovo in 2005 -- and expanded in areas such as software and services, where its technological might and consulting expertise offer better profit potential.</p>              <p>IBM in 2012 was the No. 3 player in the market for low-end servers, after Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell, according to Gartner. IBM ended the year with 15% of the market by revenue, down from 16.4% in 2011. H-P's share fell to 32.4% from 35%, and Dell's slipped to 21.4% from 21.8%.</p>              <p>Despite the low margins for x86 servers, adding IBM's business could help closely held Dell generate greater economies of scale as the company shifts its focus toward corporate clients.

He described Springer's approach as buying new-economy assets for old-economy prices.</p>              <p>""We are disciplined when it comes to price,"" said Mr. Dopfner, who declined to discuss Forbes. ""We will definitely not go hunting trophies in the U.S. seeking prestige."" He listed three criteria for pursuing targets: ""a reasonable price, if we can become a market leader and if it fits with our core competencies.""</p>              <p>A relatively unknown competitor in the U.S., Springer is the largest newspaper publisher in Europe by circulation. The company was founded by publisher Axel Springer, a staunch anticommunist, after World War II. He built the company's towering headquarters right next to the Berlin Wall so he could peer down into the streets of East Berlin.</p>              <p>The company's digital overhaul has accelerated over the past two years. It has reoriented its business and made more than two dozen acquisitions, mostly of small online companies. Mr. Dopfner described his strategy as getting back to the roots of the newspaper business: hard-hitting online news, financed by digital subscriptions, online advertising and digital classifieds.</p>              <p>""And that's our business model,"" he said. ""It's old and boring and very predictable. And it seems to work.""</p>              <p>Springer's revenue from digital media rose to 1.1 billion euros in 2012 from 24 million euros in 2006. Operating profit on digital businesses rose to 243 million euros from 1 million euros during the same period. Digital businesses account for nearly 60% of Springer's operating profit today, up from just 4% in 2008.</p>              <p>Springer is vying with several bidders, including two from Asia to buy Forbes Media LLC, people familiar with the situation said. The deadline for final bids was Monday evening in New York. The Forbes family wants to retain a minority stake and management control, according to a document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The family is seeking as much as $400 million for the company, a person familiar with the talks said. Forbes declined to comment.</p>              <p>The Asian bidders are Chinese conglomerate Fosun International Ltd. and Singapore-based holding company Spice Global Pvt. It wasn't clear what other bidders remained.</p>              <p>Springer walked from bidding wars before. Last summer the company dropped out of the running for Scout24 AG, a European digital classified-ads business.</p>              <p>If Springer does nab Forbes, the German company could keep the family involved as shareholders and in management. Springer typically looks for companies with solid business plans and good management and prefers retaining managers.</p>              <p>""They are very entrepreneurial,"" said Joern Nikolay, head of the Munich office of General Atlantic LLC. The investment fund owns a 30% stake in Axel Springer Digital Classifieds, a growing holding of e-commerce sites. ""They give their management teams a lot of freedom and the companies they acquire tend to have very strong CEOs.""</p>              <p>Springer is best known for the Bild Zeitung, Germany's best-selling daily newspaper and a force in domestic politics.</p>              <p>Mr. Dopfner was born in 1963 and studied music, becoming a music journalist before his eventual appointment as editor in chief of Die Welt, Springer's august but struggling national daily. Inside Springer he is often referred to as a Schongeist, or aesthete, for his love of classical music and art. Standing more than 6 1/2 feet tall, he has more of a global strategic vision than many of his predecessors did.</p>              <p>""He was different than the others,"" said Inge Kloepfer, author of a biography of Friede Springer, the founder's widow. Ms. Springer appointed Mr. Dopfner as CEO in 2002. ""She liked him because he was young, untainted, and brought this refined quality to the company,"" Ms. Kloepfer said.</p>              <p>Mr. Dopfner has stressed the need for the company to grow beyond Germany's borders and transform to meet challenges of the digital age.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Kenan Machado contributed to this article.</p>              <p>Credit: By William Boston</p>                      "

Now the two are going to the public market to sanctify their union.</p>              <p>WH Group, the firm formerly named Shuanghui International Holdings that acquired Smithfield Foods last year, is set for an initial public offering of up to $6 billion in Hong Kong, The Wall Street Journal reported. That should leave a financially solid firm ready to harvest the gains of the combined operations.</p>              <p>First, WH Group will move the pork, then the pigs. Smithfield's U.S. operations raise 16 million hogs a year, says BOC International, an IPO sponsor. Some of this can be exported to China, where nearly 60% of the world's pork is eaten, according to Euromonitor. Despite China's lower wages, raising hogs is 15% cheaper in the U.S., according to the Agriculture Department.</p>              <p>In recent years, Smithfield was successful in moving away from distributing unbranded pork chops and the like toward branded products such as sausages. That approach should do well in China, where food safety is a sensitive issue.</p>              <p>Longer-term benefits may come from importing Smithfield's hog-producing efficiencies. Many Chinese pigs still are raised on small farms. The government has given incentives to firms such as WH Group to gain market share.</p>              <p>Smithfield's buyout price was about 13 times forward earnings, making the IPO's suggested 20 times multiple seem rich. But combined with WH Group's higher margin distribution business, and the potential for it to be a key player in China's modernized pork supply chain, the valuation should inch toward Chinese milk giant Mengniu Dairy, on 26.3 times, or Hormel Foods, on 20.7 times. The price may seem high, but the flavor could be worth it.</p>              <p><object class=""mstar_link_to_media""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""6""/><param name=""mstar_lm_alignment"" value=""Left""/><param name=""mstar_lm_display_control"" value=""Embed""/><param name=""mstar_lm_pred_equation"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_type"" value=""Illustration""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_id"" value=""1""/></object></p>              <p>Credit: By Abheek Bhattacharya</p>                      "

Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index has dropped 4.5 percent since April 10, when the WH Group began marketing its offering.</p>              <p>""This particular deal tells you everything that's wrong with the Hong Kong I.P.O. process,"" said a person briefed on the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""With the crazy number of banks working on the I.P.O., people were worried to tell the truth to the company and just said what the client wanted to hear.""</p>              <p>Hong Kong is one of the world's biggest markets for new share sales, topping the global ranks in terms of the amount of money raised from 2009 to 2011 as more and more Chinese companies have gone public.</p>              <p>But in recent years, deals have been characterized by the growing number of banks involved -- a trend that is intended to help ensure success but that also risks a situation in which individual banks devote less time and resources to marketing an offering. The China Galaxy Securities Company, a midsize state-owned brokerage firm, set the previous record for number of underwriters -- 21 -- in May 2013.</p>              <p>The cancellation of the WH Group's offering is particularly notable because, as originally presented, it would have been the world's biggest offering since that of a Brazilian insurer, BB Seguridade Participações, in April 2013, for $5 billion. </p>              <p>WH, previously known as Shuanghui International, paid $4.7 billion in cash last year for Smithfield Foods, the biggest pork producer in the United States. It was the biggest buyout ever of a United States company by a Chinese one. The offering of the newly combined businesses originally sought to raise as much as 41.2 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $5.3 billion, when it was announced this month.</p>              <p>But the deal was met with a cold reception, and the company announced last Friday that it would reduce the number of shares it planned to sell by more than half but keep the marketed price range the same, at 8 to 11.25 Hong Kong dollars a share. Despite this, investors failed to warm to the deal.</p>              <p>Another factor that hindered WH's success was an outbreak of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus that started to take hold among pigs in the United States last year. The situation has worsened in recent months, with Chinese regulators imposing temporary restrictions on imports of live hogs from the United States.</p>              <p>That has driven up hog prices sharply in the United States, creating problems for WH. Despite the lower costs of labor and other factors in China, hog prices in the United States have typically been lower because of more efficient production methods and lower feed costs.</p>              <p>WH has announced plans to use its purchase of Smithfield to export lower-cost United States pork to China, the world's biggest pork consumer, where it can be sold at a premium because of its high quality and because of food safety concerns among Chinese after adulterants and pollutants have been found in products as diverse as eggs, rice and pork in recent years. But rising pork prices in the United States make that a less profitable trade.</p>              <p>Investors were also put off by the company's high level of debt, largely the result of its borrowing to acquire Smithfield.</p>              <p>Moreover, as part of cutting the size of its offering, WH said that existing shareholders would cancel their plans to sell shares in the offering. But that touched off worries among potential investors that those shareholders would eventually seek to dispose of large stakes, which could have pushed down the price of the stock after it listed.</p>              <p>Those investors include CDH Investments, a big Chinese private equity group; Goldman Sachs; the company's management; the Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings; and New Horizon Capital, a private equity firm co-founded by the son of Wen Jiabao, a former Chinese prime minister.</p>              <p>Among the 29 banks that were involved in the deal, seven had taken the lead as joint sponsors. They were Bank of China International, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered, Citic Securities International, Goldman Sachs, UBS and DBS.</p>              <p>This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. </p>              <div><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""39""/><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""Photograph""/><div class=""Photograph_content""><p>A Stall in Nantong in the Jiangsu Province of China, Which Is the World's Biggest Pork Consumer.

That would be down 14% from H-P's peak employment of 350,000 employees in the fiscal year through October 2011.</p>              <p>H-P's revenue peaked that year, too, at $127 billion. It has fallen each year since. Revenue in fiscal 2013 was 12% below the peak, while H-P's workforce was 9.2% below its peak. Sales are expected to decline again this fiscal year.</p>              <p>""They are right-sizing the company for its revenue,"" said Sanford Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi.</p>              <p>Mr. Sacconaghi and some other analysts interpreted the new layoffs as a potentially worrisome sign, suggesting that the Silicon Valley company could face tougher challenges ahead as Chief Executive Meg Whitman hits the midpoint of her five-year turnaround.</p>              <p>Other analysts said the latest restructuring would buy Ms. Whitman more time to boost H-P earnings.</p>              <p>Ms. Whitman portrayed the cuts as an opportunity to streamline the company further and make it more nimble. An expected $1 billion in cost savings in fiscal 2016 would allow H-P to invest in new technologies and skills to revive growth, she said.</p>              <p>UBS analyst Steven Milunovich suggested that the layoffs would make it harder to retain and attract talent. ""H-P justifies the [restructuring] charges by pointing out it continues to find savings, but there is no free lunch and we expect morale/hiring problems,"" he wrote last week.</p>              <p>H-P Chief Financial Officer Cathie Lesjak said she didn't believe that layoffs would complicate the company's turnaround and that employee engagement had improved in a recent company survey. The first 34,000 layoffs ""did not impact morale, or at least we did not see it,"" she said.</p>              <p>H-P is among several large business-technology companies trying to refresh their talent and technology.</p>              <p>International Business Machines Corp. continually rebalances its workforce to adjust to technology shifts and has expanded its employee footprint outside the U.S. IBM also has been fairly aggressive at acquiring companies.</p>              <p>Since taking over in late 2011, Ms. Whitman has stabilized H-P from mishaps, such as a botched $11 billion acquisition of U.K. software maker Autonomy Corp. and years of board and management turmoil. H-P's stock price has more than doubled since late 2012 and recently touched a new 52-week high. The company's shares closed at $33.35 on Wednesday, up 25 cents for the day and up 4.9% from May 22, before the new layoffs were announced.</p>              <p>But the challenges of executing a turnaround amid major technology shifts remain. H-P generates nearly two-thirds of its revenue from personal computers, servers, storage and printers -- mature hardware markets that are being undermined by the growing popularity of mobile devices, cloud computing and digital-printing services.</p>              <p>H-P's enterprise group, which makes computer servers, storage and networking equipment, generates about one-fourth of the company's revenue, and roughly 40% of operating earnings. H-P says it is increasing investment in computing hardware for businesses.</p>              <p>At IBM, 14% of the company's $100 billion in revenue last year came from hardware. And that share will shrink if the company gets approval for its plan to sell its low-end server business to China-based Lenovo Group Ltd.</p>              <p>H-P has struggled to expand its software and services businesses. Software sales dropped 1.6% in the first half of this fiscal year and accounted for 3.4% of revenue. Services accounted for 20% of sales, though the unit's sales fell 7.2%.</p>              <p>Ms. Whitman said the company is looking for small to midsize acquisition candidates in cloud computing, security and analytics software.</p>              <p>Early last year, Ms. Whitman said H-P's revenue could increase in the current fiscal year. But after a stumble several months later, she said that was unlikely.</p>              <p>Ms. Whitman since has been careful to avoid predicting when H-P's revenue will increase again, though she has said that remained a goal.</p>              <p>Wall Street analysts don't see H-P growing again until 2017.</p>              <p>Goldman Sachs analyst Bill Shope wrote that ""serial restructuring cannot solve H-P's secular challenges, particularly following years of underinvestment.""</p>              <p>Credit: By Spencer E.

By comparison, Apple Inc. sold 26 million units of its newest iPhone 5S in the same period.</p>              <p>""What we found was that the North American market was exceptionally tough,"" Motorola President Rick Osterloh said in an interview.</p>              <p>The Moto X sold for $600, without a contract, when it went on sale in September, though Google subsequently lowered the price to $399. Apple's latest iPhone sells for $650 without a contract.</p>              <p>The plant-closing announcement comes four months after Google said it agreed to sell the Motorola handset business to Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group Ltd. for $2.9 billion. That deal is expected to close later this year, according to the Motorola spokesman. Mr. Osterloh said the decision to close the plant was independent of the planned sale.</p>              <p>Mark Randall, Motorola's senior vice president for supply chain and operations, said the company opened the plant to configure devices quickly for U.S. consumers. Poor Moto X sales meant the company couldn't achieve economies of scale, he said, while costs for labor and shipping parts were higher than in overseas plants.</p>              <p>The spokesman said Motorola will continue making the Moto X in China and Brazil.</p>              <p>Late last year, Motorola began pursuing a new ""value"" strategy to sell smartphones at lower prices than rivals, a strategy Mr. Osterloh said will continue. The smaller profit margins may help Motorola regain market share, though they put more pressure on the company to control costs.</p>              <p>Motorola's Moto G costs $219 off-contract for a version that works with the latest wireless standard; the Moto E costs $129.</p>              <p>Strategy Analytics said three million Moto G's sold in the first quarter. Most of those sales are in developing countries like Brazil and India, so Mr. Randall said it wouldn't make sense to make the Moto G in Fort Worth.</p>              <p>""Manufacturing or assembling smartphones in the U.S. was always going to end in tears for Motorola,"" Strategy Analytics analyst Neil Mawston said. ""The U.S. is well positioned to design smartphones, as Apple does successfully, but manufacturing them is a whole different ballgame.""</p>              <p>Credit: By Rolfe Winkler</p>                      "
"83","2014-07-16","U.S. News: Court Backs Chinese Firm Over White House --- Ruling Says Company's Rights Were Violated in National-Security Review of Purchase of Wind Projects Near Naval Facility","1545175297","Wall Street Journal","A.3","            >                             </title>            >                          <p>A Chinese-owned company scored an unprecedented legal victory over the White House on Tuesday in a ruling that could shake up the secretive government review process that weighs the national-security implications of foreign acquisitions in the U.S.</p>              <p>A federal appeals court ruled the Obama administration violated Ralls Corp.'s rights when it reviewed the company's purchase of several wind-farm projects near a naval-weapons training facility in Oregon. The president prohibited the purchase in 2012, the first such action in 22 years.</p>              <p>The decision is a setback for the Obama administration and for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which reviews foreign acquisitions of American companies to ensure the deals don't pose a national-security threat.</p>              <p>The ruling may not change the bottom-line outcome in the Ralls dispute, in which the president ordered the company to sell its wind-farm assets. Nor will it likely have implications for past reviews by the 39-year-old body.</p>              <p>The president retains the power to block the Ralls deal, though he must give the company a chance to make its case to the administration before the White House makes a final determination.</p>              <p>Tuesday's decision could give foreign firms more leverage and greater legal protections as they seek to expand in the U.S. Foreign companies for decades have had virtually no say in the review process, but the ruling could require the administration to give them access to the unclassified evidence it considers in making its decision.</p>              <p>Several high-profile deals are now before the review board.</p>              <p>Russia's state-controlled oil giant, OAO Rosneft, recently put to the board its bid to buy Morgan Stanley's oil-trading unit. The ruling could also affect China's Lenovo Group Ltd., which is seeking to buy the computer-server business of International Business Machines Corp. for $2.3 billion as well as Google Inc.'s Motorola Mobility phone business. IBM and Lenovo in May refiled their application with CFIUS to gain more time.</p>              <p>Last year, CFIUS cleared the biggest purchase ever of a U.S. company by a Chinese firm, the $4.7 billion acquisition of Smithfield Foods Inc. by Shuanghui International Holdings, despite vocal complaints from members of Congress about risks to the national food supply.</p>              <p>In the Ralls case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the company should be given access to any unclassified evidence the president relied on to make his decision. It also said the company should have a chance to respond to that evidence.</p>              <p>""Ralls never had the opportunity to tailor its submission to the [government's] concerns or rebut the factual premises underlying the president's action,"" the appeals court said in its opinion.</p>              <p>Companies previously haven't been entitled to such procedural protections during the review process, said Harry Clark, a lawyer with Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe LLP. ""Nothing like this has ever been available,"" he said. ""Transacting parties have had virtually no leverage.""</p>              <p>A lawyer for Ralls said the company was heartened that the court ""ordered the government to disclose the reasons why it deprived Ralls' property. We look forward to further vindicating Ralls' right to be treated fairly and equally under the law."" He said the company was evaluating its options regarding the wind-farm assets, which he said still haven't been sold.</p>              <p>Sany Group, the Chinese construction and machinery firm whose executives control Ralls, couldn't immediately be reached for comment.</p>              <p>An executive of Sany previously accused the Obama administration of blocking the deal to support U.S. industry.</p>              <p>The Justice Department said it was reviewing the ruling, but U.S. officials declined to comment further. The administration has more legal options: It could ask the appeals court to rehear the case, with all active judges participating, or it could appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>              <p>The decision is a victory for the Chinese government, which has pushed hard -- even in recent days -- to win more transparency in the national-security review for companies looking to buy American firms. In 2012, Chinese entities, led by manufacturing companies, filed 23 deals with CFIUS, up from 10 in 2011 and six in 2010.</p>              <p>The review board doesn't publicly disclose the cases it considers or their outcomes. In most cases, companies that trigger national-security concerns work with the committee's lawyers to mitigate the perceived risks.</p>              <p>Foreign companies buying businesses in the U.S. often file with the committee voluntarily, though they can also be forced to file.</p>              <p>If no agreement is reached, the president can issue an order barring the transaction. Companies ordinarily have no way to appeal the decision.</p>              <p>The ruling ""will help create some transparency in the CFIUS process,"" said William Vigdor, a lawyer with Vinson &amp; Elkins LLP who represents companies that go through the national-security review for proposed transactions.</p>              <p>Credit: By William Mauldin and Brent Kendall</p>                      "

That deal remains the biggest-ever buyout of an American company by a Chinese one.</p>              <p>The enlarged group announced plans in April to raise as much as $5.3 billion in a Hong Kong initial public offering, a deal that was criticized as being bloated with an unprecedented 29 underwriters. The I.P.O. was later slashed to $1.9 billion before ultimately being canceled because of lackluster demand.</p>              <p>Investors were put off by WH's hefty debt levels, the I.P.O.'s steep asking price and the company's decision to award its top two executives a combined $600 million bonus for 2013. On top of this, an outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in the United States led to sharp increases in hog prices this spring, complicating WH's plans to export pork from the United States to China.</p>              <p>Now WH is trying again, hoping that a more modest fund-raising target, a cheaper valuation and only two underwriters -- Morgan Stanley and Bank of China International -- will help ensure success.</p>              <p>The company plans to raise 15.9 billion Hong Kong dollars by selling 2.567 billion new shares, or an 18 percent stake, in an I.P.O. priced at 6.20 dollars per share, a person with direct knowledge of the deal said Tuesday, declining to be named because the information was not yet public. In April, the company had sought to sell the shares in a price range of 8 dollars to 11.25 dollars apiece.</p>              <p>The company's management will start a roadshow to market the deal to potential investors on Wednesday, the person said, with final pricing scheduled to be set Tuesday and trading in the shares to begin on Aug. 5.</p>              <p>About 30 large financial institutions, including sovereign wealth funds and hedge funds, have tentatively given commitments to subscribe to the shares, which are being offered at a valuation that represents 11.5 times the company's estimated earnings for 2014, the person added. That compares with a price-to-earnings multiple of 15 times at Henan Shuanghui Investment &amp; Development, WH's domestic unit, which is listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange.</p>              <p>This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. </p>                      "

Then, pork prices in the U.S. spiked, undercutting an important rationale for the acquisition: that the company could import cheaper U.S. pork to China.</p>              <p>The current IPO is expected to raise $2.05 billion, less than half the $5.3 billion it was seeking when the IPO failed in April, both because it will offer fewer shares and because it has cut the price.</p>              <p>This time, shares will be offered at 11.5 times forward 2014 earnings, rather than the 15 times to 20.8 times implied by the prices for its attempt in April. ""This time we go for an attractive valuation and leave some money on the table,"" said a person with direct knowledge of the deal.</p>              <p>WH Group plans to sell 2.57 billion new shares at a fixed price of 6.20 Hong Kong dollars (80 U.S. cents) per share. Back in April, WH at one stage tried to sell 3.65 billion shares -- comprising 2.92 billion new shares plus 731 million shares from existing shareholders -- priced in a range of HK$8 to HK$11.25 per share. It then cut the IPO size after failing to attract enough investors for a deal. Still, the IPO was called off in April.</p>              <p>This time, the company also cut the number of underwriters to two -- Morgan Stanley and BOC International, the investment-banking arm of Bank of China Ltd. -- from 30 last time. The unusually large number of banks on the original deal caused confusion and poor communication with big investors.</p>              <p>The money raised will help the company pay down some of its $4 billion in debt from the acquisition and give it more financial flexibility. But there will still be debt. WH Group's debt-to-equity ratio will fall to 107% after the share sale, compared with 243% at the end of March, but that lower ratio is still considered high.</p>              <p>The company says most of the debt that comes due in 2016 will be paid back after the listing, while the rest, due in 2018, will be paid by cash generated from operations and bank financing.</p>              <p>Alex Au, managing director of Alphalex Capital Management, whose fund placed an order to buy WH Group shares in the current Hong Kong offering, said besides cutting the debt burden, the company will get better borrowing terms in the future because it is publicly listed. Still, Mr. Au said, ""I am concerned more about whether WH can deliver synergy between their U.S. and China operations.""</p>              <p>One goal of the deal was for WH Group to import Smithfield pork to China, taking advantage the American company's reputation for quality and safety. It began importing pork in January and sells Smithfield products in central China's Henan province, where WH Group's China operation is based.</p>              <p>-- Prudence Ho</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>AUDIO</p>              <p>Bose Files Patent Suit</p>              <p>Against Beats Electronics</p>              <p>Bose is suing Beats Electronics, the headphone and speaker maker that Apple Inc. agreed to acquire for $3 billion earlier this year, for infringing on patents related to its noise-canceling technology.</p>              <p>Bose filed the lawsuit on Friday in U.S. District Court in Delaware, saying that Beats -- known for its colorful and flashy headphones -- had infringed on five of its patents pertaining to its noise-canceling headphones.

"88","2014-11-12","TPG's Bet Goes for Brokers --- Buyout Firm Seeks Commercial-Property Play With Foray Into Services","1622567223","Wall Street Journal","C.6","            >                             </title>            >                          <p>Private-equity firms are amassing a growing pile of money from investors looking to bet on rising commercial-property prices around the world.</p>              <p>TPG is taking the wager a step further by snapping up commercial real-estate brokers that match up buyers and sellers and landlords and renters.</p>              <p>A venture led by TPG last week closed on a $1.05 billion acquisition of Chicago-based DTZ, a real-estate services firm with 209 offices in 52 countries and more than $1.9 billion in annual revenue. TPG is planning to merge DTZ with Cassidy Turley, a Washington, D.C., firm the venture is set to buy before the end of the year in a deal valued at as much as $600 million.</p>              <p>The TPG venture, whose investors also include PAG Asia Capital and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, expects to make further acquisitions in coming months as part of a push to become the world's third-largest commercial real-estate services firm, after CBRE Group Inc. and JLL, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>              <p>The lures for TPG are twofold. In the short term, it seeks commissions and other fees that are growing fatter. The industry generates more than $100 billion in annual revenue but is highly fragmented; CBRE and JLL dwarf their rivals yet account for a small fraction of the market, with CBRE bringing in $7.18 billion last year and JLL $4.46 billion.</p>              <p>In the longer term, TPG's strategy is to cash out of its investment, likely through a sale or initial public offering. The industry is expected to keep growing as world economies recover, institutional investors vie for more property and corporations increasingly outsource their real-estate needs, analysts say.</p>              <p>""Things are really humming along right now, and I don't expect them to change anytime soon,"" says Mitch Germain, analyst at JMP Securities.</p>              <p>TPG's effort comes as growing institutional demand for property world-wide is pushing prices to records in many cities including London, New York and San Francisco. A DTZ research report in October titled ""The Great Wall of Money"" said capital targeting property acquisitions increased 15% in the first half of 2014 to $408 billion, the most since the firm began publishing reports on the subject in 2009.</p>              <p>Private-equity firms, including TPG, have ridden this enthusiasm to raise $65 billion in property funds in the first three quarters of 2014, up from $56 billion in the same period last year and the most raised in the first three quarters of a year since 2008, according to Preqin, a data tracker.</p>              <p>Along with rising deal volume have come rising brokerage commissions. Commercial real-estate firms also are seeing fee revenue increase from other services such as appraisals, property management and helping businesses plan their space needs throughout the world. Shares of CBRE and JLL are trading near post-bust highs.</p>              <p>TPG, which has $66 billion in assets under management, is known mainly as a leveraged-buyout shop. But it has been investing in property for years out of its general funds, and earlier this year began raising money for its first real-estate-specific fund, with a goal of at least $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The DTZ deal is being run out of the firm's Asia office and is being financed out of one of its corporate funds.</p>              <p>TPG isn't the only investment firm to spot opportunity in the sector. Italian investment company Exor SpA, owner of Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc., is considering a plan to boost spending for expansion in that company, according to people familiar with the matter. BGC Partners Inc., a Cantor Fitzgerald spinoff, has been investing heavily to expand New York-based Newmark Grubb Knight Frank.</p>              <p>That competition is driving up prices of smaller brokerage firms. DTZ, CBRE and Cushman &amp; Wakefield are all among the bidders for Massey Knakal Real Estate Services, a firm that specializes in sales in the New York region and is being marketed by Perella Weinberg Partners. It could fetch as much as $100 million,according to people familiar with the matter. That would be about seven times earnings, a high price in the brokerage business, analysts say.</p>              <p>TPG seeks to challenge the industry's biggest players. Currently, Cushman &amp; Wakefield has the third-highest revenue among global firms, with $2.74 billion in the year that ended June 30. Once the TPG group combines DTZ with Cassidy Turley, the combined revenue of the two firms will be about $2.9 billion.</p>              <p>""In this sector today, there have been only two true global champions until now,"" said Ben Gray, TPG's managing partner in Asia, who is leading the effort. ""There's absolutely the opportunity to grow a third.""</p>              <p>Building a company through acquisitions is challenging in the commercial real-estate business. Brokers tend to be protective of their client relationships and can walk out the door if they aren't happy.</p>              <p>TPG plans to bring in Brett White, the former chief executive of CBRE until he stepped down in 2012, to be its executive chairman when his noncompete agreement with CBRE expires next year. Messrs. Gray and White met in 2000 when Mr. White was CBRE's president and Mr. Gray worked for the firm as a young investment banker for what was then Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>              <p>Credit: By Peter Grant</p>                      "

He also wants to invest in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which produces the James Bond movies.</p>              <p>The potential acquisition would accomplish two things: provide a steady stream of popular movies for Chinese theaters, and make Wang's Dalian Wanda Group a more powerful force in the global entertainment industry. Dalian Wanda also owns AMC Theatres, the No. 2 chain in the U.S.</p>              <p>""Many people come knock at my door, but Wanda is only interested in the big players, and we want control,"" Wang told Bloomberg News. ""China's movie industry is booming at unprecedented speed. Buying a well-known U.S. company will help our distribution overseas.""</p>              <p>Lionsgate, MGM and Wanda all declined to comment. Shares of publicly traded Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. rose about 3% Monday on speculation of a possible deal.</p>              <p>Although a deal is uncertain, industry analysts were not surprised that Chinese theater interests would be looking to buy into Hollywood.</p>              <p>""Studios have both the know-how to create high-quality entertainment and the relationship with western filmmaking talent that so many Chinese companies covet,"" said Lindsay Conner, who chairs the entertainment and media practice at law firm Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips. ""If you buy a studio, you get the content, the know-how and the relationships in one package.""</p>              <p>Lionsgate is the most likely acquisition target among the Hollywood studios, with a market value less than $5 billion. The other Hollywood studios -- Disney, Universal, Sony, Paramount and 20th Century Fox -- are much bigger and are part of major media companies.</p>              <p>""I think [Wang] would prefer to buy a really big studio, but those are not for sale,"" said Stanley Rosen, a USC professor and expert on the Chinese film business. ""Lionsgate is kind of the last of the independent studios where there's a chance you can actually afford it.""</p>              <p>And Lionsgate has what Wanda lacks: a pipeline of franchise movies that have a track record overseas, especially in China.</p>              <p>In addition to the ""Hunger Games"" films, Lionsgate has scored overseas hits with ""Divergent,"" ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part I"" and ""Escape Plan,"" which last year pulled in about $41 million in ticket sales in China.</p>              <p>Chinese entertainment companies like Wanda need Hollywood content to help fill their theaters and cater to a growing box office that is expected to reach about $5 billion this year and surpass the U.S. by 2019. China is adding about 10 theaters a day. Leading much of the multiplex growth is Wanda Cinema Line Corp., with more than 1,247 screens in 149 Chinese theaters.</p>              <p>Lionsgate could help Wanda Group expand globally. The studio has had a surge in revenue in the last year, with help from its franchise films and growth in its television division. The company posted a net income of $20.8 million, or 15 cents a share, for the three months that ended Sept. 30. That's up from $505,000 in the same period last year.</p>              <p>Lionsgate has also already branched out to the Chinese market. In July, Lionsgate teamed up with Chinese e-Commerce giant Alibaba to launch a subscription streaming service for mainland China. The service, called Lionsgate Entertainment World, allows users of the platform to watch box-office and television favorites such as ""Divergent"" and AMC's ""Mad Men"" on set-top boxes.</p>              <p>Wang, a real estate tycoon who is one of China's wealthiest men, made a splash two years ago when his company acquired AMC Entertainment for $2.6 billion, creating the world's largest theater chain.</p>              <p>In 2012, he told The Times that he planned to invest $10 billion in U.S. companies in the next decade, which could include buying department stores, hotel management companies and at least one more cinema chain. Worldwide, Wanda plans to invest as much as $30 billion in the next decade.</p>              <p>In addition to AMC Theatres, Wanda recently bought the site of the former Robinsons-May department store in Beverly Hills, where it will invest $1.2 billion to build a mixed-use development. The company also announced a $20-million donation to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for its forthcoming film museum.</p>              <p>Dalian Wanda Group isn't alone in its attempt to make Hollywood connections. Because China is the world's second-largest film market, Chinese companies have looked to studios to increase their stakes in the industry.</p>              <p>In October, Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba Group, visited major studios for a series of sit-downs with high-level executives. Ma was said to be mulling investing in Lionsgate.</p>              <p>Rosen said that Wang's attempt to buy Lionsgate is undoubtedly supported by the Chinese government, which sees film as a way to expand through ""soft power.""</p>              <p>""He is establishing his footprint,"" Rosen said of Wang. ""He's becoming a global player, which is exactly what the Chinese government wants their big names to be doing.""</p>              <p>Doing so, however, requires making films with broad international appeal.</p>              <p>""China is getting better at making movies for its own citizens, but creating a global footprint to match Hollywood would be difficult to do on its own,"" said Phil Contrino, vice president and chief analyst at BoxOffice.com.</p>              <p>But deals between large Chinese companies and major studios haven't necessarily come to fruition.</p>              <p>Huayi Bros. Media Corp., a Beijing film production company, was in talks this year to invest as much as $150 million in Studio 8, the film company led by former Warner Bros. Pictures Group President Jeff Robinov. But negotiations reportedly fell apart, leading Huayi to invest in its own U.S. subsidiary.</p>              <p>Rosen said that even if Wanda can't buy a controlling stake in Lionsgate, it could make a significant investment and ""gradually build up.""</p>              <p>Wang held an Oct. 8 meeting in Beijing with Lions Gate Entertainment Chairman Mark Rachesky, the studio's largest shareholder, with a 37% stake, according to a news post on the Chinese company's website.</p>              <p>In addition to cinemas, Wanda has been a key player in growing China's film industry. The company recently partnered with the Qingdao municipal government in eastern China to launch a fund that would provide as much as 1 billion yuan ($162 million) annually to support film and TV productions.</p>              <p>Billed as the first of its kind in China, the subsidies would mainly be available to projects that film at Qingdao Oriental Movie Metropolis, a sprawling production facility recently launched by Wanda Group that aims to be the ""Hollywood of China.""

If he succeeds, Mr. Yang will have turned Lenovo into China's first true global powerhouse, with a sizable presence in multiple sectors.</p>              <p>A first step is reintroducing Motorola to China. Motorola said Tuesday it will sell the Moto X and two other smartphone models in China starting in February.</p>              <p>Mr. Yang said the company plans to make Motorola an online-marketed brand in China. This would position Motorola as Lenovo's horse in the fierce contract-free race currently led by Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. With a valuation of more than $46 billion, Xiaomi is the world's largest tech startup. Lenovo-brand phones would continue to be sold through carriers.</p>              <p>""There will be a separation,"" he said. ""Lenovo will continue to focus on the carrier market, so probably mainstream to entry level [prices]. Motorola will focus more on the open market and online sales . . . the premium and mainstream price bands.""</p>              <p>Lenovo is also counting on the Motorola brand to carry its sales in countries such as the U.S., where Lenovo phones have previously had a limited presence, Mr. Yang said.</p>              <p>While Mr. Yang doesn't expect Motorola to be profitable for four to six quarters, he reaffirmed that the new server unit from IBM is likely to turn a profit within the first year.</p>              <p>Lenovo will also save costs on the server business because of overlapping components with its PCs, he said.</p>              <p>The acquisitions put Lenovo on a course to surpass $40 billion in revenue this year, as the company marches toward Mr. Yang's long-term goal of $100 billion, said Lenovo Chief Operating Officer Gianfranco Lanci.</p>              <p>The company posted record revenue of $38.7 billion in 2014.</p>              <p>Lenovo executives said they are aware of the potential pitfalls for integrating acquisitions.</p>              <p>""Look at PC history,"" said Mr. Lanci, who was president of Taiwanese PC maker Acer Inc. when it acquired U.S. computer maker Gateway Inc. in 2007. ""Most of the acquisitions have been failing simply because people have not been able to understand other people's culture."" He mentioned Samsung Electronics Co.'s purchase of U.S. personal-computer maker AST Research Inc. in the 1990s, which ended with AST's closure after Samsung couldn't make it profitable.</p>              <p>But Mr. Lanci said Lenovo's 2005 acquisition of IBM's PC unit had succeeded, in part, because of Mr. Yang's willingness to listen and learn. He said Mr. Yang relocated from his home country, China, to the U.S. for several years after the deal to learn English and better understand the IBM PC business.</p>              <p>Mr. Yang said last year's deals fulfill a long-held goal for Lenovo to expand beyond PCs.</p>              <p>""These acquisitions can help build our brand,"" he said.</p>              <p>Credit: By Eva Dou</p>                      "

Real-estate brokers and analysts said Chinese companies see luxury hotels, especially in major global capitals, as long-term investments that can provide steady income in a period of low interest rates. Moreover, some say the properties confer prestige on their owners.</p>              <p>""Chinese insurers are buying for 50 or 100 years, and they are not worried about value going down in markets like New York,"" said Ryan Meliker, hotel analyst for investment bank MLV &amp; Co. ""It's a great place to park money long term.""</p>              <p>China's Anbang Insurance Group Co. in October agreed to pay $1.95 billion to Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. for the famed Waldorf-Astoria on New York's Park Avenue. China property investor Dalian Wanda Group Co. last year put $900 million toward a Chicago skyscraper with a luxury hotel. Chinese investors also have bought hotels in Sydney, Washington and Los Angeles in the past year.</p>              <p>Real-estate broker JLL estimates Chinese companies will spend more than $5 billion on overseas hotel investments this year, up from $920 million last year and $130 million in 2012.</p>              <p>The Chinese government's recent liberalization of rules that had limited corporate investments abroad is helping to fuel the buying, said Gilda Perez-Alvarado, head of the Americas for JLL's global hotel group.</p>              <p>Under the new rules, Chinese firms can invest up to $1 billion without seeking government approval, up from $100 million before last year's changes.</p>              <p>Mr. Sternlicht's Starwood Capital Group LLC built the luxury hotel and high-end condominium project with Tribeca Associates, a New York real-estate developer. The two haven't disclosed how much they spent on the project. Starwood, which acquired French crystal maker Baccarat in 2005, will continue to manage its namesake hotel.</p>              <p>Mr. Sternlicht founded Starwood in 1991, and it has expanded into one of the world's largest real-estate investment firms. He also was chief executive of Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide Inc. before leaving the company in 2005.</p>              <p>The opulent 114-room property features 15,000 pieces of crystal stemware and 17 chandeliers from France's Baccarat factory. Minibars are stuffed with treats from Parisian gourmet shop Fauchon, and the property features a spa offering six kinds of facials. Suites are expected to fetch up to $18,000 a night.</p>              <p>The Baccarat is slated to open its doors next month. It is rare for a buyer to commit to a luxury property that has no track record and no guarantee it can get the $900 to $1,000 a night that Starwood plans to charge for standard rooms.</p>              <p>That makes it a more speculative investment than the Plaza Hotel, which has been operating for more than a century.</p>              <p>""This only occurs in very robust market conditions,"" said Sean Hennessey, chief executive officer of Lodging Advisors, a hotel-consulting firm. Because hotels aren't preleased like office buildings, the risk of filling the guest rooms now falls to the new owner, he said.</p>              <p>Some brokers said that if the Baccarat can charge what it hopes, the hotel could be valued at more than what Sunshine is paying. Hotels also are the most resistant type of property to inflation because room rates can be reset at any time.</p>              <p>A luxury hotel like the Baccarat should produce annual adjusted operating income of about 3% to 4% of the purchase price, or roughly twice the yield of 10-year U.S. Treasury notes, said Mr. Meliker, the MLV analyst.</p>              <p>There are also strategic reasons for closely held Sunshine to buy before the opening, Mr. Hennessey said. The company gets a new asset in a crucial market without having to wait years to develop a similar property.</p>              <p>This isn't the first wave of foreign buying of trophy U.S. commercial properties. Japanese conglomerates were big buyers during the 1980s, and there has been a steady stream in recent years of petrodollars from Middle Eastern and Asian government funds.</p>              <p>Chinese insurers have been active buying hotels and other real estate overseas. Only about 1% of these insurers' assets are in real estate, said JLL's Ms. Perez-Alvarado, who expects that number to climb closer to the 4% she says is more common among Western insurers.</p>              <p>The Baccarat sale would follow a record-breaking year for the hospitality industry. U.S. hotels had their highest-ever average daily rate of $115 a night and revenue per available room of $74, according to STR. Leisure travel remained robust, while group travel rebounded 4.4% in 2014.</p>              <p>Scott Berman, head of the hospitality group for PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC, said 2015 looks just as strong.</p>              <p>Broker Eastdil Secured advised the sellers on the Baccarat and Waldorf sales.</p>              <p>Credit: By Craig Karmin and Esther Fung</p>                      "

Undeterred, Mr. Ashi flew to Montreal and persuaded the owners to sell him the Palm Beach hotel and the Florida rights, opening the door to Miami Beach.</p>              <p>This month, Mr. Ashi said he would build a third Four Seasons hotel, less than 30 miles up the coast from Miami Beach in Fort Lauderdale. His firm, Fort Capital Management, and partners are spending a combined $1 billion on acquisition and construction costs for all three properties in the south Florida market. He said he is exploring near Naples, Fla., for another Four Seasons location.</p>              <p>""It has more prestige and greater client recognition"" than the other brands, Mr. Ashi said of his decision to go with Four Seasons, which will manage the properties that Fort Capital is developing.</p>              <p>Mr. Ashi is part of a new vanguard of developers entering untapped markets for the 54-year-old hotel brand, which hit a rough patch during the economic downturn and whose chief executive left in 2013 after three years in the top position.</p>              <p>Four Seasons already is among the world's largest luxury hotel operators, managing 95 hotels in 39 countries. But under Chief Executive Allen Smith, the company is competing to expand the Four Seasons' footprint by persuading more hotel investors to back its brand against a rising tide of rivals, from Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. to Middle Eastern and Asian operators, in the same global hot spots.</p>              <p>The Four Seasons in Miami Beach will be part of the Surf Club, a 1930 private club that attracted celebrities like Frank Sinatra and Grace Kelly and statesman Winston Churchill, who used to paint seascapes while nestled in a bathing hut.</p>              <p>Costs to acquire and renovate the club, and to build a 77-room hotel with an adjoining 150 luxury residences, are expected to be $650 million. The changes are being overseen by prizewinning architect Richard Meier and seem to be paying off already. Mr. Ashi said he has sold three-quarters of the condos for a combined $900 million and will collect $1.25 billion if the remaining units sell at listed prices.</p>              <p>The condos, which Mr. Ashi said have sold primarily to financiers and money managers from the Northeast, fetched an average price of $8 million, or $2,400 a square foot. He aims for the Four Seasons to charge an average daily rate of $1,000 a night when it opens next year, a price that would be among the highest in the U.S.</p>              <p>Mr. Ashi said Fort Capital has a real-estate portfolio valued at about $1.8 billion, based on a $600 million equity investment, mortgage loans and price appreciation. But he isn't well known outside of his home base of Miami. Last year, he teamed with a Qatari family and a Turkish family to bid $1.7 billion for the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York, getting edged out by China's Anbang Insurance Group Co.'s $1.95 billion bid.</p>              <p>""We would have matched the price,"" he said. But he was reluctant to offer the 100-year management contract that Anbang reached with the seller, Hilton, he added.</p>              <p>Mr. Ashi, 52 years old, was born in Liberia to Lebanese parents before moving with his family to Paris at the age of 12. He studied engineering at George Washington University, started and sold an information-technology company, then moved to Miami to try his hand at real estate. He started out buying distressed condo projects in 2009 with a Brazilian partner. Finding tepid demand for the apartments during the downturn, they hopped a flight to Sao Paulo, where wealthy Brazilians bought more than 20 units.</p>              <p>By the time the condos had sold out, Fort Capital had doubled its $70 million investment, Mr. Ashi said. He used those profits toward the purchase of the Surf Club.</p>              <p>He then spent several months trying to persuade the Palm Beach Four Seasons owner to sell. Lyon Sachs, one of the partners who sold Mr. Ashi the property, said he initially refused to sell the Four Seasons rights but came around to the developers' persistence.</p>              <p>Credit: By Craig Karmin</p>                      "

The new owners will get an initial income return from the sprawling office complex of a mere 4.3%, according to a Green Street Advisors estimate.</p>              <p>But they aren't stopping there. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Brookfield Chief Executive Ric Clark made it clear that the venture plans to develop aggressively Canary Wharf's 30 acres of vacant land.</p>              <p>Songbird -- whose biggest shareholders are China Investment Corp., Morgan Stanley and U.S. investor Simon Glick -- owns 69% of Canary Wharf Group, and has been planning to develop the vacant parcels for years with residential, office and retail projects.</p>              <p>Those plans were hampered by the downturn and the contraction of the financial-services industry, which traditionally rented the bulk of Canary Wharf offices.</p>              <p>In his first public remarks since the deal, Brookfield's Mr. Clark said the NEW owners are ready to provide Canary Wharf ""whatever [it] may need"" to fund its pipeline of offices, homes and shops. Over the next six to 10 years, the Canary Wharf Group plans to build 22 new buildings across four projects, providing 5.1 million square feet of new offices, shops and residential space. Canary Wharf has rights to build 11 million square feet.</p>              <p>Mr. Clark declined to estimate costs. But Green Street estimates the cost of building up Canary Wharf's mixed-use development pipeline is roughly GBP 600 a square foot, or GBP 3.06 billion for 5.1 million square feet.</p>              <p>Canary Wharf Group ""can look to their deep-pocketed sponsors in order to help support the business plan,"" Mr. Clark said.</p>              <p>The venture's bullish plans for Canary Wharf highlight global investors' continued faith in the London market even after several years of sharp increases in real-estate values. Investors point to rising office, apartment and retail rents as evidence that the market still has a way to run.</p>              <p>The Brookfield-Qatar venture launched its hostile takeover in November. To succeed, they needed to convince at least one of Songbird's three major shareholders -- China Investment Corp., Morgan Stanley and U.S. investor Mr. Glick -- to sell their stakes.</p>              <p>""Going into this, we knew CIC and Morgan Stanley would be sellers. Simon Glick was a bit of an unknown,"" Mr. Clark said. CIC wasn't immediately available for comment. Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Mr. Glick wasn't able to be reached for comment.</p>              <p>Brookfield has relationships with both CIC and Morgan Stanley, Mr. Clark said. ""We didn't waste opportunities to bring up Canary Wharf when we saw them,"" he said.</p>              <p>So when it came to making the approach, ""we knew at the right price, they'd both exit,"" he said.</p>              <p>QIA and Brookfield launched a 295 pence-per-share bid in November. Songbird responded by publishing an independent report highlighting Canary Wharf's development pipeline that valued shares at 381 pence.</p>              <p>The bid was later sweetened to 350 pence per share.

Numerous firms had been vying for the No. 3 spot but none have come close to CBRE with $9 billion in 2014 revenue and JLL with $5.4 billion.</p>              <p>The combined company, which will have more than $5 billion in annual revenue and 250 offices in more than 50 countries, will keep the Cushman &amp; Wakefield name.</p>              <p>The firm will be run by Brett White, former chief executive of CBRE who helped build that firm into the largest in the world.</p>              <p>Mr. White, who stepped down from CBRE in 2012, recently has been working closely with the TPG venture, which also includes PAG Asia Capital and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. In the past six months, the venture also purchased DTZ for $1.05 billion and Washington-based Cassidy Turley in a deal valued at as much as $600 million.</p>              <p>Mr. White said in an interview that the firm plans to continue expanding by tapping cash flow as well as ""further capital"" from the TPG group.</p>              <p>The new Cushman &amp; Wakefield will be a ""third formidable competitor at the highest end of this industry,"" which is currently ""a bit of a two-horse race,"" he said.</p>              <p>The deal, which is expected to close later this year, comes at a time of rapid consolidation in the real-estate-services business. The industry in recent years has expanded from brokerage into a wide range of other services, including asset management, consulting and corporate security.</p>              <p>Business has been booming partly thanks to strong demand for commercial property in many markets throughout the world.</p>              <p>Founded in 1917, Cushman &amp; Wakefield is being sold by Exor SpA, the investment arm of Italy's Agnelli family, which bought a 67.5% stake in the firm in late 2006 for $565.4 million and later boosted its ownership to 81%.</p>              <p>Cushman &amp; Wakefield suffered losses during the early years of the downturn but has been chalking up profits since the market recovered.</p>              <p>Cushman &amp; Wakefield went on the block earlier this year. But its chief executive, Edward Forst, made it clear at the time that he didn't want to sell to a competitor. Rather, he hoped another investor would take Exor's place and provide capital for the firm's expansion.</p>              <p>Mr. White said it became clear during negotiations that a merger would accelerate Cushman &amp; Wakefield's expansion.</p>              <p>""They wouldn't have to wait five years to be the company they wanted to be,"" he said. ""They only needed to wait a few months for us to close the transaction.""</p>              <p>For example, Cushman in recent years has been trying to increase its recurring fee revenue and rely less on commissions, which can vary greatly in boom and bust cycles, Mr. White noted. The new firm will get about 50% of its revenue from recurring business, compared with about 40% today.</p>              <p>Mr. White said Mr. Forst would leave the company once the transaction closed. Tod Lickerman, now DTZ's chief executive, will become president of the combined firm. The chief integration officer and chief operating officer will be John Santora, currently chief executive of North America at Cushman.</p>              <p>The combined company will have about 43,000 employees around the world. Mr. White said Cushman &amp; Wakefield is strong in geographic areas and businesses where DTZ is weak, and vice versa.

It gained access to China's low-cost mobile market initially while sharing technology with the Chinese company.</p>              <p>Tsinghua Unigroup's ambition to become a powerhouse of semiconductors is aligned with China's investment of billions of dollars to build a national champion in the industry, complementing its growing strengths in networking and computing.</p>              <p>In part, China's top officials have been galvanized to improve their technological self-sufficiency by former U.S. security contractor Edward Snowden's disclosures in 2013 that the U.S. government was spying through backdoors inserted in some U.S. technology products.</p>              <p>The worries about foreign suppliers have helped spur the sales of Chinese companies like Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., which are major suppliers of networking equipment; Lenovo Group Ltd., which sells PCs and other hardware; and server-maker Inspur Group Co.</p>              <p>Tsinghua is widely expected to face tough scrutiny in Washington from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which reviews international transactions on national-security grounds.</p>              <p>The fact that Tsinghua is a state-owned company means the bid would automatically be scrutinized by higher-level officials who work with the panel, which is known as CFIUS and comprises numerous government departments. If serious national-security concerns arise, President Barack Obama may block the deal.</p>              <p>A spokesman for the Treasury Department, which leads CFIUS, had no comment. U.S. officials have a policy of not commenting on individual cases, whose deliberations and decisions are secret. A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington wasn't available to comment.</p>              <p>Semiconductors are a newer focus for China. Leo Li, chief executive of Spreadtrum Communications Inc., Tsinghua Unigroup's largest chip-making subsidiary, told The Wall Street Journal in January that China's central government had expressed interest in building ""safe phones"" for government officials in which all the core components were made domestically.</p>              <p>China's technology effort has put a chill on the sales of U.S. companies, including International Business Machines Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. and Microsoft Corp., according to people familiar with the matter. Cisco, for example, reported in May that fiscal third-quarter revenue from selling products in China fell 30%, while total product revenue rose 6% from a year earlier. IBM in April reported its first-quarter revenue from China decreased 36.6%, while total revenue decreased 12%.</p>              <p>Memory chips are one of the most important segments of the semiconductor sector, serving as essential parts of all kinds of computers and most mobile devices. Micron, based in Boise, Idaho, is the last remaining U.S. supplier of a widely used variety called dynamic random access memory, or DRAM. It also makes NAND flash memory, which stores data in smartphones and other mobile devices.</p>              <p>Tsinghua Unigroup's prepared bid is $21 a share, according to people familiar with the matter. That is a 19% premium over Micron's closing price Monday, but well below Micron's $35 share price at the end of 2014 before its earnings were hit by a slowdown in the personal computer business.</p>              <p>The Chinese firm presented the bid to Micron's management, a person familiar with the situation said. A Micron spokesman said the company hadn't received a buyout offer and declined further comment.</p>              <p>It isn't clear whether and when the state-owned Chinese group will follow up. If it does, there is no guarantee Micron will be open to a deal given the possibility that regulators would nix any agreement, the reluctance with which many U.S. companies view Chinese suitors, and the fact that the price is well below the Idaho firm's December high.</p>              <p>Micron's shares rose more than 11% to $19.61 Tuesday on news of the Tsinghua bid, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.</p>              <p>Analysts were doubtful Micron would accept such a low offer and skeptical the U.S. government would allow such a transaction. ""People are very skeptical that a deal like this would go through,"" said Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura Securities.</p>              <p>The firm has a number of options, including pushing the Chinese company for a higher offer and seeking other bids amid a wave of consolidation in the semiconductor industry.</p>              <p>Though its factories turn out many kinds of high-tech products, China lags behind other countries in chip manufacturing. Some kinds of semiconductor production equipment are subject to U.S. export controls aimed at restricting access to technology that could help make state-of-the-art chips. The companies Tsinghua Unigroup has acquired so far specialize in designing chips, leaving the manufacturing to others.</p>              <p>Making memory chips requires advanced manufacturing know-how and design expertise. Srini Sundararajan, managing director of Summit Research Partners, said China lags in the development of memory chips and spends $13 billion a year buying chips from overseas.</p>              <p>He said Tsinghua Unigroup's interest in Micron is part of broader strategic efforts to correct this deficiency. The chip maker holds many memory-technology patents and maintains advanced factories in the U.S., Taiwan, Japan and Singapore.</p>              <p>""If they were to acquire Micron, they would automatically get onto the leading edge of technology,"" said Jim Handy, a market researcher who focuses on memory at the firm Objective Analysis.</p>              <p>Tsinghua Unigroup was founded in 1988 by China's elite Tsinghua University, the alma mater of Chinese President Xi Jinping and other senior government officials. The company still has the ear of leaders in Beijing in part through such connections. The son of former Chinese President Hu Jintao was previously the Communist Party head of the firm's parent company.</p>              <p>Under Chairman Zhao Weiguo's leadership, Tsinghua Unigroup is perhaps best described as an opportunist rather than an arm of Beijing. Mr. Zhao, who made a fortune in coal and natural gas before joining Tsinghua Unigroup, had latched onto the opportunity to buy Spreadtrum in 2013 when it was looking to go private, people familiar with the matter said.</p>              <p>Mr. Zhao shifted into high gear as China declared the chip sector a key priority and earmarked billions of dollars for development after the Snowden disclosures. Beijing's chip-support fund said in February it would invest 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) in Tsinghua Unigroup over the next five years.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Liz Hoffman, William Mauldin and Dana Mattioli contributed to this article.</p>              <p>Credit: Eva Dou, Don Clark</p>                      "

He is the new chief executive of Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc. in the wake of its $2 billion merger with DTZ that closed earlier this month.</p>              <p>Mr. White, who served as CBRE's CEO for seven years before stepping down in 2012, has a formidable to-do list. Besides integrating Cushman and DTZ, he must reduce debt, improve margins and build revenue in preparation for an expected initial public offering.</p>              <p>An IPO will likely be the exit plan of the investment group that has spent more than $3.5 billion in the past 12 months to buy Cushman, Chicago-based DTZ and Washington-based Cassidy Turley. The group includes private-equity firm TPG, PAG Asia Capital and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan.</p>              <p>Analysts say the clock is ticking to catch the hot market that pushed shares of the two largest public real-estate services firms, Los Angeles-based CBRE and Chicago-based JLL, to record highs earlier this year.</p>              <p>""Recognizing where we are in the cycle, they're going to have to get this thing out there,"" says Brandon Dobell, an analyst with financial-services firm William Blair &amp; Co.</p>              <p>The Cushman deal closed at a time of intense recruitment battles in the industry, in part because of the strong leasing and sales markets in many countries. Meridian Capital Group LLC on Monday announced it had hired Helen Hwang, a 16-year Cushman &amp; Wakefield veteran and one of its top sales brokers in New York.</p>              <p>But Mr. White has a reputation for recognizing and poaching talent. He also is credited with helping lead CBRE's transformation from a traditional brokerage to a global firm that offers a wide menu of interlocking services, including investment management and running facilities for some of the world's largest corporations.</p>              <p>Founded close to a century ago in New York, Cushman &amp; Wakefield has numerous strengths, including a top global brand. The firm, headquartered in Chicago in the wake of the DTZ merger, has combined revenue of $5 billion, which already makes it a top-tier player. JLL's 2014 revenue was $5.43 billion, and CBRE's was $9.05 billion.</p>              <p>""I would not have gone back to run a company were it not a combination as exciting and compelling as this one,"" Mr. White says.</p>              <p>Mr. White declined to comment on the timing of any possible initial public offering.</p>              <p>To get Cushman ready for an IPO, analysts say, the firm needs to reduce the debt on its balance sheet mostly resulting from the TPG investment group's acquisition binge. In July, Moody's Investors Service projected the combined firm's debt would be 5.2 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

"104","2015-10-14","WSJ.D Technology: VMware's Sales Key To Dell Deal's Future","1721853836","Wall Street Journal","B.4","            >                             </title>            >                          <p>Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>              <p>VMware Inc., a seller of data-center software, expects to achieve $1 billion in total revenue synergies from Dell Inc.'s proposed acquisition of EMC Corp., VMware's biggest shareholder. A Technology article Wednesday about VMware and the deal incorrectly said VMware expects to achieve such synergies annually.</p>              <p>(WSJ October 15, 2015)</p>              <p>Pat Gelsinger recalls when as an up-and-coming Intel Corp. executive he first met Michael Dell, then a 21-year-old college dropout trying to negotiate the best possible price on a batch of Intel's 386 microprocessor chips for his company.</p>              <p>""He cut the deal. And the tenacity has allowed him to be a huge entity,"" said Mr. Gelsinger, now chief executive of VMware Inc., a seller of data-center software that Mr. Dell would acquire as part of his proposed $67 billion acquisition of EMC Corp.</p>              <p>Although the deal envisions VMware remaining a publicly traded company, it would see closely held Dell Inc. become the largest shareholder, as EMC is today. Both companies will have to work hard to maintain VMware's growth rate and achieve a projected $1 billion in annual revenue synergies.</p>              <p>That is no small thing. VMware's shares, which changed hands at $91.14 in early August, were hit hard in reaction to the Dell-EMC merger. The stock is off 15%, at $69.31, since a potential deal was first reported last week. The lower share price along with possible disruptions from the change in ownership could affect VMware's ability to retain top talent in the tight Silicon Valley labor market, say analysts.</p>              <p>VMware investors were spooked on Monday when along with the deal's announcement the company disclosed preliminary third-quarter results, which showed a lower-than-expected 8% increase in bookings. They are also concerned that the merger, which awards EMC shareholders with a VMware tracking stock in addition to cash, will dilute demand for VMware shares.</p>              <p>""From an investor perspective, there is going to be a surge of stock that's going to come to the market,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co.</p>              <p>Mr. Gelsinger, 54 years old, said he is relieved to be on firm corporate footing. EMC had sought to sell itself for several years as shareholders also pressed it to spin off VMware amid grim prospects for the Hopkinton, Mass., parent's data-storage business.</p>              <p>Dell, as a favored VMware partner after the merger, is expected to open $1 billion in new opportunities for VMware to sell its virtualization software, which makes computers more efficient by allowing them to run more than one operating system simultaneously. However, VMware can't appear to favor Dell in ways that would hurt its customers that buy servers from Hewlett-Packard Inc. or Lenovo Group Ltd. -- Dell's arch rivals -- or that could hurt it in the virtualization market, where VMware competes with Microsoft Corp., Red Hat Inc. and a variety of alternatives.</p>              <p>""There's a lot of concern about the synergies from the transaction,"" said Brent Thill, an analyst and managing director with brokerage UBS. ""Will Dell really be additive or will it really be a nuisance for VMware?""</p>              <p>Mr. Gelsinger declined to say how long it would take VMware to realize the projected $1 billion in revenue synergies, but he said much of it would come from selling VMware software to Dell's small and medium-size customers.</p>              <p>VMware is the biggest vendor for cloud system management software with 21.6% of the $2.3 billion market, according to research firm International Data Corp. It is also the top vendor in the $2 billion data center automation software market with a 24% share, estimates IDC.</p>              <p>But market changes could reshape its role. VMware is used in a majority of corporate data centers but risks being left behind as corporate information technology departments move to cloud-computing services such as Amazon.com Inc.'s Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure, which doesn't use its software.</p>              <p>Credit: By Robert McMillan</p>                      "

Beijing is expected in the next few weeks to make its selection.</p>              <p>Starwood has been running a strategic review process for months and listening to merger bids from companies around the globe, said people familiar with the process. A Starwood spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>              <p>The Stamford, Conn., hotel operator controls brands like Westin, W Hotels and St. Regis and has more than 1,200 properties world-wide. In April, Starwood's board indicated it would be open to a sale amid concerns it wasn't growing as fast as rival hotel operators.</p>              <p>It isn't clear how much the Chinese companies might be willing to pay for Starwood, but people familiar with the discussions said any bid would come at a premium to Starwood's market value, which was nearly $12 billion at the start of Tuesday.</p>              <p>Shares of Starwood rose 9.1% to 74.81, the stock's largest single-day gain since 2009, after news of Chinese interest.</p>              <p>A deal would represent the largest-ever acquisition of a U.S. company by a Chinese entity, according to data tracker Dealogic. In 2007, CIC paid $5.6 billion for a 9.9% stake in Morgan Stanley, currently the largest dollar investment from China in a U.S. company.</p>              <p>A spokesman for Jin Jiang, which has four publicly listed subsidiaries, said ""at the moment, the listed part of the company has no intention to acquire Starwood."" He declined to comment further. A spokeswoman for HNA said she has ""no relevant information."" A representative of CIC didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>              <p>The talks over Starwood are the latest sign of Chinese companies' global ambitions in the hospitality sector. Anbang Insurance Group Co. this year paid nearly $2 billion for the Waldorf-Astoria hotel on New York's Park Avenue, a record sales price for a U.S. hotel. Another Chinese insurer paid about $230 million, or more than $2 million a room, for New York's Baccarat Hotel. That was an all-time high on a per-room basis.</p>              <p>Beijing might opt to discourage any Chinese bid for Starwood if the price is seen as too high, the people said. Of the three Chinese firms interested in the U.S. hotel company, Jin Jiang and CIC are state controlled, while HNA is partly owned by the government. What's more, any or all of the Chinese companies could decide not to follow through with a bid.</p>              <p>The jockeying illustrates a unique aspect of the Chinese deal-making process. As Chinese companies increasingly flex their muscles on the world stage, authorities often want to make sure they don't bid against each other and drive up the price. The government also must approve major corporate investments abroad.</p>              <p>The long process could potentially make Chinese firms miss the best time to cut a deal, Chinese executives said.</p>              <p>Starwood has its own challenges. Chief Executive Frits van Paasschen left in February after the board lost confidence in his ability to grow the company, say people familiar with the board's thinking. In April, Starwood said it had hired investment bank Lazard to help the company explore strategic alternatives including a possible sale or merger.</p>              <p>Since then, the company has continued to sell hotel properties, and it is in advanced talks to sell its timeshare business for at least $1 billion, according to people familiar with the company.</p>              <p>Despite the prominence of its higher-end and lifestyle brands, Starwood has struggled to find a winning formula in the increasingly lucrative limited-service-hotel segment. Its Sheraton brand, which accounts for more than 40% of Starwood's room total, has lost ground to rivals and Starwood is trying to reinvigorate the brand.</p>              <p>While people familiar with the sale process said over a dozen companies have inquired about a possible combination with Starwood, it is unclear how many have made formal offers. That could leave the field open for a Chinese bidder.</p>              <p>The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., whose members include secretaries of Treasury, Homeland Security and Defense, likely would have to approve any Chinese deal for Starwood. Lawyers said an acquisition by a state-owned Chinese company could draw extra scrutiny.</p>              <p>""Anything involving Russia or China and remotely connected with national security will draw a closer look,"" said Joel Brenner, a lawyer specializing in national security issues.</p>              <p>The committee approved Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.'s sale of the Waldorf to the Chinese insurer, but during a visit last month President Barack Obama broke with a longstanding tradition of presidents staying at the Waldorf by opting for another Manhattan hotel.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Yang Jie contributed to this article.</p>              <p> </p>              <p> </p>              <p><object class=""mstar_link_to_media""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""6""/><param name=""mstar_lm_alignment"" value=""Left""/><param name=""mstar_lm_display_control"" value=""Embed""/><param name=""mstar_lm_pred_equation"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_type"" value=""Illustration""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_id"" value=""1""/></object></p>              <p>Credit: Lingling Wei, Craig Karmin</p>                      "
"106","2016-01-06","Dalian Wanda May Buy Majority Stake in Legendary Entertainment","1753352935","New York Times","B.3","            >                             </title>            >                          <p>LOS ANGELES --  The Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group, which already owns the AMC chain of multiplex cinemas, is poised to buy a majority stake in a Hollywood production company that makes blockbuster-style movies, giving the politically powerful company with close ties to the Communist Party's ruling elite a foothold in the heart of America's entertainment industry.</p>              <p>Investors in the production company, Legendary Entertainment, have agreed to sell Wanda their stakes in a deal that values Legendary at about $4 billion, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a transaction that was not yet public. The investors cashing out of Legendary own a little more than 50 percent of the company, these people said.</p>              <p>The rest of Legendary will continue to be owned by its management, including Thomas Tull, a former laundromat owner who founded the production company in 2000 and turned it into a Hollywood powerhouse. Legendary's hits include ""Godzilla"" and ""Pacific Rim."" It has also been trying, with limited success, to develop a television division.</p>              <p>Industry experts say the deal makes sense for both Wanda and Legendary, which tends to produce the type of big-budget, special-effects-driven movies that Chinese audiences like. In addition to owning AMC, Wanda controls the biggest cinema chain in China, where box-office receipts are set to eclipse the North American market in coming years. Wanda, a company owned by Wang Jianlin, China's richest man, can provide Mr. Tull with money, a growing audience and a champion in China that can get more of his films into the tightly controlled market.</p>              <p>""Wanda represents a good source of funding for him,"" Peter Schloss, managing partner of CastleHill Partners, a merchant bank specializing in the media and sports industries, said by telephone from Beijing. ""Wanda likes the deal because it segues into the approach that they are using to build themselves into a multifaceted entertainment conglomerate.""</p>              <p>The deal, earlier reported by Reuters, deepens Wanda's foray into the movie production business. Wanda made a splash in 2013 when it announced the construction of a mammoth, $8.2 billion studio in eastern China, flying in stars like Leonardo DiCaprio and Nicole Kidman for the occasion. Last year, Wanda helped produce ""Southpaw,"" a boxing movie starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Rachel McAdams, which was released by the Weinstein Company. Wanda bought the AMC chain for $2.6 billion in 2012, including $2 billion in assumed debt.</p>              <p>Wanda's investment also makes sense politically for its chairman, Mr. Wang, a former military officer who is carrying out the Communist Party's goal of deepening China's influence in the global entertainment industry. As many of China's most powerful families, including relatives of President Xi Jinping, have bought shares in Wanda, the Legendary purchase furthers Mr. Wang's importance to the country's political elite at a time when some of the country's richest businessmen are falling victim to Mr. Xi's anticorruption campaign, now entering its fourth year.</p>              <p>""He's basically putting himself in such an important position that makes it really difficult for the government to go after him, because he's actually carrying the water for the government in terms of making inroads into Hollywood,"" said Stanley Rosen, a professor of political science at the University of Southern California who studies China's film industry. ""That's an important aspect of government policy.""</p>              <p>Still, Mr. Rosen said that the deal was best explained in business terms for Wanda, a private company, allowing it to leap over competitors like Alibaba, which is also expanding its presence in Hollywood. And since Legendary's primary focus is on American-style action movies, the opportunities for China to use the deal to increase its global ""soft power"" are limited. ""If you're not promoting Chinese values and not promoting Chinese films overseas, how will this help Chinese power?"" Mr. Rosen asked by telephone.</p>              <p>Ticket sales in China grew nearly 50 percent in 2015, to $6.78 billion, according to government data. (""Pacific Rim,"" for instance, collected $112 million in China in 2013.)</p>              <p>Coming Legendary films include a ""Godzilla"" sequel that pairs the radioactive lizard with King Kong, and ""Warcraft,"" an expensive adaptation of the popular video game. Legendary releases its films in partnership with Universal Pictures, a division of NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast.</p>              <p>A spokeswoman for Legendary declined to comment.

Until now, Chinese media companies have pursued narrower deals in Hollywood, such as investing in movies or providing financing for co-productions.</p>              <p>Wanda's more ambitious play could signal a new phase in the growing ties between the entertainment industries of the two countries.</p>              <p>Wanda, China's largest cinema company, has already made headlines with its U.S. investments. In 2012 it acquired AMC Entertainment, owner of the nation's second-largest movie theater chain, for $2.6 billion.</p>              <p>""The U.S. investments in AMC, and now possibly Legendary, would give them a seat at the table in Hollywood, and therefore clout in the rest of the world where Legendary-branded films would play,"" said Rance Pow, president of Artisan Gateway, a film industry consulting firm.</p>              <p>Legendary already has a significant presence in China, where it has an agreement to co-produce movies with the state-owned China Film Co. Among them is the big-budget science-fiction movie ""The Great Wall,"" the upcoming Universal Pictures release starring Matt Damon.</p>              <p>Wanda would give Legendary a stronger foothold in a country expected to surpass the size of the North American box office by 2017. The expanding box-office revenue in China -- ticket sales surged nearly 50% last year -- makes China an increasingly valuable market to U.S. film companies and has prompted a flurry of deals on both sides of the Pacific.</p>              <p>At the same time, acquiring Legendary could significantly boost the ambitions of Wanda, which is building what it bills as ""the world's largest film and television studio"" in the eastern Chinese city of Qingdao, where parts of ""The Great Wall"" were filmed. Spread across more than 400 acres, Wanda Studios Qingdao will house 30 soundstages, a facsimile of a New York City street, a temperature-controlled underwater stage, the country's largest exterior water tank and postproduction facilities. The first phase of the studio is scheduled to open in 2017, and the company is seeking to lure both Chinese and international productions to the facility.</p>              <p>Last spring, Wanda touted the studio at Cannes and the AFCI locations show in Los Angeles, where it was the only Chinese company to attend. Nancy Romano, chief operating officer of Wanda Studios Qingdao, said at the time that productions would be eligible for ""extremely generous"" incentives. For the studio's launch ceremony in 2013, Wanda flew in many Hollywood celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio and John Travolta, to give the event some high-wattage star power.</p>              <p>""Nothing comes as a surprise in the age of global mergers and acquisitions, with Chinese firms playing an increasingly prominent role in the 2010s, replacing the Japanese in the late 1980s and the Koreans in the late 1990s,"" said Ying Zhu, a professor at City University of New York who focuses on the Chinese entertainment industry.</p>              <p>The sale would put Legendary, founded in 2005 by Thomas Tull, under the control of Wang Jianlin, Wanda's chairman and one of China's richest men. Two years ago, Wang openly expressed interest in buying Lionsgate, the independent studio behind the ""Hunger Games"" franchise, but a deal never materialized.</p>              <p>Wanda asserted its influence in other ways. In 2013 it donated $20 million to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for its film museum on the Los Angeles County Museum of Art campus. A year later, Wanda bought the site of the former Robinsons-May department store in Beverly Hills and announced plans for a $1.2-billion mixed-use development there.</p>              <p>Representatives of Wanda and Legendary declined to comment.</p>              <p>Reuters, which first reported on the pending deal, said the transaction values Legendary at $3 billion to $4 billion.</p>              <p>Japanese telecommunications firm SoftBank Group Corp. and investment firm Waddell &amp; Reed Inc. have also agreed to sell their stakes in the company.</p>              <p>Wang has repeatedly emphasized his desire to go global and signaled that he intends to do that through mergers and acquisitions.</p>              <p>""We seek to become a world-class multinational company and a famous brand,"" Wang said at the company's semiannual meeting in July, telling investors that doing so ""is also a core element of our transformation"" from being simply a real estate company.</p>              <p>He forecast that by 2020, 30% of the company's revenue would be from overseas, and said that overseas merger and acquisition activities would increase in 2016. Wanda is looking in particular at ""cultural industries,"" sports and finance.</p>              <p>Last year, Wanda acquired the Swiss sports marketing company Infront Sports &amp; Media for more than 1 billion euros, purchased the organizer of the Ironman triathlon races for $650 million, bought a 20% stake in Spain's Atletico de Madrid soccer club, and took over Australia's second-largest cinema chain, Hoyts, for about $365 million.</p>              <p>""Top 500 companies are constantly changing but they have one thing in common -- none of them reached such a scale entirely through their own development,"" Wang said at the investors' meeting. ""All of them have engaged in mergers and acquisitions. To rapidly become a world-class [multinational company], Wanda can only take one path in its overseas development and that is to mainly depend"" on mergers and acquisitions.</p>              <p>Wang has spoken repeatedly of his desire to create a vertically integrated entertainment company spanning production, distribution and exhibition. Wanda Pictures and its recently launched Wuzhou Film Distribution subsidiary distributed 14 films in 2015, including ""Mojin: The Lost Legend,"" which has raked in nearly $239 million in mainland China since opening in mid-December.</p>              <p>In an 2012 interview with The Times, Wang said he planned to invest $10 billion in the U.S. over the next decade, which might include real estate, hotels, department stores and another movie chain. He also said he was seeking partnerships with Hollywood studios.</p>              <p>""We would like to invest in film production, and we'd like to partner with directors, actors and filmmakers from Hollywood,"" he said.

"109","2016-01-16","GE Deal Long in Coming For Haier","1757198369","Wall Street Journal","B.1","            >                             </title>            >                          <p>Haier Group's proposed $5.4 billion takeover of General Electric Co.'s appliance business would hand the Chinese manufacturer a substantial position in the U.S. market after a decade of trying.</p>              <p>The deal would vault the state-owned company past Electrolux AB and other rivals in the U.S. appliance market -- currently led by Whirlpool Corp. -- and help bolster profit margins that have been thinned by growing competition in its home market. Haier twice before tried to buy its way into American market. In 2005 it courted Maytag Corp. but ultimately lost out to Whirlpool. Haier tried to buy the same GE business in 2008 before the deal was pulled amid the global recession.</p>              <p>""Haier is committed to investing in the U.S.,"" Haier Chief Executive Zhang Ruimin said in a statement announcing the deal. It caps a wave of Chinese companies buying businesses abroad and would be the largest acquisition of an American business by a Chinese firm, eclipsing the 2013 purchase of Smithfield Foods Inc. by Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd., according to data from Dealogic.</p>              <p>Haier would take over GE's nine appliance-manufacturing facilities, 12,000 U.S. workers and a long-established brand that would help expand its line of home goods from niche products like wine refrigerators and window air conditioners to $10,000 ranges and refrigerators that connect to the Internet. Haier said it would have the rights to use the GE brand for appliances for 40 years.</p>              <p>For GE, the deal caps a protracted sales process that proceeded by fits and starts for the better part of a decade as Chief Executive Jeff Immelt sought to shed the consumer-facing unit and sharpen focus on industrial businesses such as jet engines and locomotives.</p>              <p>GE had tried to sell the business to Sweden's Electrolux in 2014 for $3.3 billion, but that fell apart in December after U.S. antitrust enforcers sued to block that transaction, saying the combination would hurt competition for cooktops and ranges. Just over a month later, GE has found another buyer at a higher price.</p>              <p>The transaction could draw scrutiny by U.S. authorities given that Haier is a state-owned company and Mr. Zhang is a member of China's Central Committee, one of the Communist Party's highest decision-making bodies. It also comes in an election year when candidates vying for the presidential nominations have taken jabs at China's growing global clout.</p>              <p>GE officials expressed confidence the deal wouldn't be blocked by regulators. Chip Blankenship, CEO of Louisville, Ky.-based GE Appliances, said in an interview that Haier's U.S. market share is small, so it shouldn't raise the same concerns that thwarted the Electrolux deal.</p>              <p>Typically hurdles arise in Chinese acquisitions related to technology or defense, so an appliance deal may not turn up a security threat, said Michael Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. ""This is an issue more about brand acquisition,"" Mr. Wessel said.</p>              <p>In 2005, for example, Cnooc Ltd. abandoned its effort to acquire U.S. oil producer Unocal in the face of intense opposition in Washington.</p>              <p>The GE Appliances acquisition would mark the third major overseas purchase by Chinese companies this week. Other deals involved the purchase of a German manufacturer and one to buy a Hollywood production and finance company.</p>              <p>Based in China's northeastern coastal city of Qingdao, Haier started in 1984 as a successor to a loss-making refrigerator factory that had been opened in 1949, when Chairman Mao Zedong founded modern China.</p>              <p>Mr. Zhang, now 67 years old, is a prominent figure in business circles back home. He started building a no-nonsense reputation when, as newly appointed chairman in 1985, he smashed with a sledgehammer a faulty refrigerator to demonstrate zero tolerance for shoddy products at the factory.</p>              <p>He helped build the brand by investing in a cartoon in the 1990s called the ""Haier Brothers,"" creating mascots that many in China recognized long after the airing of more than 200 episodes. Today, Haier has become one of China's most valuable brands, worth $1.9 billion in 2015, according to media agencies Millward Brown and WPP.</p>              <p>Although it had $32.6 billion in revenue world-wide in 2014, Haier is little known in the U.S. The company's U.S. market share of major home appliances is 5.6% compared with 29.8% in China, according to market research firm Euromonitor.</p>              <p>Sales for GE Appliances and Lighting, of which appliances make up the lion's share, were $8.4 billion in 2014. Haier would keep GE Appliances' current leadership in Louisville, and its name.</p>              <p>Haier currently has a refrigerator factory in Camden, S.C., a plant in Mexico, and a research facility in Evansville, Ind., all of which it plans to keep open, a company spokesman said.</p>              <p>For Haier, growth overseas is critical. Not only have profit margins in China been hit by increased competition, online shopping has sparked price wars, and the housing market has cooled off.</p>              <p>Qingdao Haier Co., the unit of Haier Group that would purchase GE Appliances, trades on the Shanghai stock market. Private-equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. bought a 10% stake in the unit in 2013.</p>              <p>""Haier had always fancied themselves the GE of China so now they get the real thing,"" Bernstein analyst Steve Winoker wrote in a note.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>William Mauldin contributed to this article.</p>              <p>Credit: By Ted Mann and Laurie Burkitt</p>                      "
"110","2016-02-03","China Bids for Industrial Might","1761996174","Wall Street Journal","A.1","            >                             </title>            >                          <p>China is pursuing one of its most ambitious overseas takeover attempts yet, as China National Chemical Corp. nears an agreement to buy Swiss pesticide and seed giant Syngenta AG for roughly $43 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>              <p>These people said an agreement between the two companies could be announced as soon as Wednesday, but also cautioned that talks could still fall apart. If an agreement is reached, it would be just the start of what could be a fraught process gaining government and regulatory approval around the world, including in the U.S., the home of a sizable portion of Syngenta's seed and crop-spray business.</p>              <p>A deal would also mark a fresh height for China's deal-making ambitions as its government seeks to steer a slowing economy and build up its agricultural capabilities to feed a more affluent populace.</p>              <p>The global agricultural and chemicals industries have been reshaped in recent months by deals, initiated by U.S. seed giant Monsanto Co.'s unsuccessful $46 billion takeover of Syngenta itself, as slumping commodity prices have pressured farmers' spending.</p>              <p>Terms of the deal with China National Chemical, known as ChemChina, call for a price of about 470 Swiss francs, or $461, a share in cash, according to people familiar with the matter. Bankers and investors have said it would be difficult for Monsanto, or any other company, to match such an all-cash offer. However, another suitor could emerge.</p>              <p>If completed, the transaction would represent the largest foreign acquisition by a Chinese company by far. That honor is now held by Cnooc Ltd.'s 2013 purchase of Canada's Nexen, an oil producer, for $18.2 billion.</p>              <p>Shares in Syngenta rose sharply after The Wall Street Journal reported the talks earlier Tuesday. The stock closed up 3.7% at 392.30 francs in Zurich.</p>              <p>Syngenta is due to report 2015 full-year financial results on Wednesday.</p>              <p>A deal would need to pass a gantlet of regulatory examinations in Europe and the U.S., which bankers and lawyers said could prove difficult. They said U.S. authorities would scrutinize the transaction. Approximately one-quarter of Syngenta's sales come from North America.</p>              <p>Syngenta is the top pesticide seller in North America in terms of revenue, and it sells 10% of soybean seeds in the U.S. and 6% of U.S. corn seeds, according to estimates from Morgan Stanley. The company was created in 2000 through the merger of the agribusiness operations of European pharmaceutical giants Novartis AG and AstraZeneca PLC.</p>              <p>The talks come amid global concerns about China's slowing economy and Beijing's attempts at managing that slowdown, partly by orchestrating a gradual easing of the country's currency. That has whipsawed not only the country's domestic stock markets, but also global shares, bonds and currencies -- while contributing to a sharp fall in commodities prices world-wide.</p>              <p>Bankers said recent takeovers by Chinese acquirers might suggest that executives there are expecting more depreciation is on the way. Doing deals now would make more sense for Chinese buyers than later, when any overseas acquisitions could be more expensive.</p>              <p>China's government, meanwhile, has been pushing development of its agricultural sector by consolidating domestic seed companies and researching biotech crops, which are genetically modified to resist bugs and pesticides.</p>              <p>Though some biotech crops, such as cotton, are allowed to be grown in China, government officials have cited safety concerns in holding off approving new ones while prodding its agricultural sector to modernize. Acquiring Syngenta, which develops genetically engineered seeds, could help further open the Chinese market to biotech crops, analysts said.</p>              <p>Despite economic headwinds at home, Chinese companies last year spent more than $112 billion on acquisitions across the globe, according to Dealogic. ChemChina has been especially prolific. Last month, it agreed to buy Munich-based equipment maker KraussMaffei Group for $1 billion. The same month, it took a 12% stake in Mercuria Energy Group, a large, privately held energy trader, for an undisclosed sum.</p>              <p>The deal would mark further consolidation of the seed and pesticide sectors after DuPont Co. and Dow Chemical Co. announced their merger in December. Monsanto last spring set off the current deal-making wave in the chemicals sector when it proposed buying Syngenta.</p>              <p>After unsuccessfully courting Syngenta investors and sweetening its offer to $46 billion in cash and stock, Monsanto dropped its pursuit in August, sending Syngenta's shares lower and leaving many Syngenta shareholders frustrated as challenges mounted for agricultural companies.</p>              <p>Syngenta's chief executive at the time retired and John Ramsay, its interim CEO, has said the company was discussing possible deals with multiple parties, a shift in its initial resistance to a takeover.</p>              <p>Some analysts think Monsanto could make another attempt. ""If I'm an investment banker and I'm unable to unearth a counteroffer, that says a lot about the state of this industry,"" said Mark Gulley, principal of New York-based chemicals consultancy Gulley &amp; Associates LLC. A Monsanto spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>              <p>A deal with ChemChina would likely need to get approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, the federal body that screens corporate takeovers for security concerns, observers say. Chinese acquisitions have undergone more intense scrutiny in the U.S. in recent years. Representatives of CFIUS didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Jacob Bunge and Brian Spegele contributed to this article.</p>              <p>Credit: By Rick Carew, Shayndi Raice and Eyk Henning</p>                      "

The Viacom Inc.-owned studio has been ranked last among Hollywood ""majors"" at the box office for four straight years. Revenue and operating income have plummeted and hundreds of employees have been laid off.</p>              <p>Now, Viacom, under pressure from investors who are frustrated with the media giant's sagging stock price and want to see major strategic moves, said Tuesday it will sell a minority stake in Paramount. The company hopes to close a deal for the 104-year-old studio by the end of June.</p>              <p>Viacom has received interest in Paramount from several companies, including at least one Asian company and a tech player, according to people familiar with the matter. The board decided unanimously to launch a formal process after a recommendation by Chief Executive Philippe Dauman -- his first major initiative since becoming executive chairman earlier this month, the people said.</p>              <p>Even as it pursues a stake sale, Paramount is hoping for a turnaround under the direction of studio CEO Brad Grey, who is aiming to ramp up production to 15 movies from 11 in the last fiscal year and is beefing up a fledgling TV production unit.</p>              <p>Letting go of even a piece of Paramount would be symbolic of the change under way at the upper ranks of Viacom. Controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone cemented his mogul status when he wrested Paramount away from rival Barry Diller for nearly $10 billion in an early-1990s bidding war. It was long the gem of his empire. Now, Mr. Redstone, 92 years old, is fading from the stage as his health deteriorates. Mr. Dauman succeeded him as chairman of Viacom and Mr. Redstone also stepped down from that role at CBS Corp.</p>              <p>""The market didn't historically view Viacom as willing to pursue value-creating opportunities like selling stakes in existing assets,"" said John Janedis, an analyst at Jefferies, in an interview. ""This is a clear change in tone.""</p>              <p>A deal would not only raise cash, but would likely send a signal to Wall Street that Paramount is worth more than the $1 billion currently implied by Viacom's stock price. Mr. Janedis estimated Paramount is worth between $3.5 billion and $4 billion.</p>              <p>Many on Wall Street and in Hollywood believe a Chinese company such as Dalian Wanda Group could be among the bidders. The company previously approached Paramount, according to people familiar with the matter. A spokesman for Dalian Wanda declined to comment.</p>              <p>Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. has also been seen as a potential deal partner for Paramount, but people close to the company said it wouldn't want to own a minority stake in a studio controlled by another company.</p>              <p>Viacom shares spiked 5% early Tuesday after the company's announcement but closed roughly flat at $37.01.</p>              <p>Mario Gabelli, the largest investor in Viacom's voting shares outside the Redstone family, had previously called on Viacom to consider selling a stake in Paramount to a company like Alibaba, and called the latest move a ""first step.""</p>              <p>""Is it being driven by a thoughtful, pre-understood plan, or is it being opportunistic?"" he said. ""My thoughts are this is opportunistic.""</p>              <p>The decline of Paramount's business has been so stark that some in Hollywood no longer count it among the major studios like Comcast Corp.'s Universal Pictures, Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros. and Twentieth Century Fox.</p>              <p>""It's pretty clear they are very different from every other studio of their caliber, in number of pictures released and number of pictures they finance,"" said Frank Biondi, senior managing director of WaterView Advisors and former chief executive of Viacom.</p>              <p>Speaking at a Jefferies conference Tuesday, Mr. Dauman called Paramount a ""significantly undervalued part of Viacom,"" noting its ""library of hit films generate recurrent income year after year.""</p>              <p>Operating income dropped from $341 million in 2011 to $111 million last fiscal year. Benjamin Mogil, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, estimates that it will continue to drop at that rate this year, hitting $51 million.</p>              <p>For more than a decade, the studio has been run by Mr. Grey along with vice chairman Rob Moore.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Shalini Ramachandran and Steven Perlberg contributed to this article.</p>              <p> </p>              <p> </p>              <p><object class=""mstar_link_to_media""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""6""/><param name=""mstar_lm_alignment"" value=""Left""/><param name=""mstar_lm_display_control"" value=""Embed""/><param name=""mstar_lm_pred_equation"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_type"" value=""Illustration""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_id"" value=""1""/></object></p>              <p>Credit: By Ben Fritz and Keach Hagey</p>                      "

The agreement, which requires government review, combines the second- and fourth-biggest U.S. movie theater chains and vaults the resulting entity past Regal Entertainment Group.</p>              <p>Exhibitors have been investing heavily in their chains, competing for fans with bigger screens and luxury seating. U.S. ticket sales, while rising to a record $11.1 billion in 2015, are little changed in recent years. China, the second-largest movie market, is growing fast and is poised to pass the United States.</p>              <p>AMC's chief executive Adam Aron said Thursday he began pursuing Carmike almost immediately after becoming chief executive in January.</p>              <p>""I called the CEO of Carmike on my first week of the job,"" he said. ""We had dinner on the third week. There was no reason to go slow. There is an old adage, 'Time is the enemy of all deals.' ""</p>              <p>Wanda was not directly involved in talks, Aron said. The parent company greenlighted his plan to grow through acquisitions and was ""enthusiastic,"" he added.</p>              <p>AMC's offer is low on a per-screen basis, and Carmike could attract a counterbidder such as Regal Entertainment, according to Eric Wold, a B. Riley &amp; Co. analyst who was recommending all three stocks. Carmike recently came under pressure from the activist investor Oasis Management.</p>              <p>""We think we did get an attractive price for Carmike,"" Aron said. ""We're quite comfortable that when all this shakes out, we will be the owner of Carmike Cinemas.""</p>              <p>Together, AMC and Carmike would have more than 600 locations in 45 states across the country, including the District of Columbia, according to the companies' joint statement. Regulators may require some divestitures, Carmike's chief executive David Passman said in an interview, adding that the talks had been going on for a few weeks.</p>              <p>""This is a compelling transaction that brings together two great companies with complementary strengths to create substantial value for our guests and shareholders,"" Aron said in the statement. The companies said the deal would generate $35 million in cost savings annually.</p>              <p>While some theater sales may be necessary, Aron said the two circuits ""were quite complementary,"" with AMC in urban markets and Carmike having a larger presence in smaller cities.</p>              <p>""We have a pretty solid understanding of what the Justice Department is interested in,"" Aron said in his interview Friday. Together, the companies' market share, at about 23 percent, is ""not the kind of market share that scares anyone.""</p>              <p>The combined company will be run by Aron, who was appointed on Jan. 4, and will keep its headquarters in Leawood, Kan., according to the statement. The transaction was approved by both boards and is expected to close by year end.</p>              <p>According to the deal terms, AMC would have to pay Carmike a reverse breakup fee of $50 million if the Justice Department blocks the acquisition. Carmike would pay $30 million if it walks away from the deal. The deal helps Wang achieve his goal of controlling 20 percent of the global film market by 2020.

The deal, which includes assumption of Carmike's debt, is valued at $1.1 billion.</p>              <p>AMC, based in Leawood, Kan., is the second-largest U.S. movie theater operator, behind Regal Entertainment Group.

Wanda, a giant in the real estate and media businesses, is also considered a potential bidder for part of Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Pictures or another U.S. studio.</p>              <p>""Certainly, Wanda's influence over the market increases with this deal,"" said Eric Handler, a media analyst at MKM Partners. ""Wanda believes in scale, and you see them making a lot of acquisitions. And I think that's also part of AMC's business plan.""</p>              <p>Wanda, which owns China's leading movie chain, became the world's largest cinema operator in 2012 when it bought AMC for $2.6 billion.</p>              <p>Leawood, Kan.-based AMC is the second-ranked U.S. theater operator, with 387 locations and 5,426 screens. If the Carmike agreement closes as planned at the end of this year, it would surpass Regal Entertainment Group as the nation's top chain, bringing its reach to well more than 600 cinemas. Carmike is the country's fourth-largest exhibitor, with 276 theaters and 2,954 screens.</p>              <p>Wanda has been on a deal-making spree. The company said last month that it will invest $3.3 billion in EuropaCity, an entertainment and retail complex near Paris.</p>              <p>""It certainly is a piece of Wanda's global ambitions in the entertainment industry, but also in the real estate market,"" said Lindsay Conner, an entertainment industry lawyer and partner in Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips. ""This [AMC] deal satisfies Wanda's corporate goal and Wang's personal goal to be the No. 1 theater business in the U.S., as they are in China.""</p>              <p>Under the agreement announced Thursday, AMC would pay $30 a share in cash for Columbus, Ga.-based Carmike and assume debt. Wall Street cheered the deal. AMC's shares rose $1.32, or 5%, to $27.02 on Friday, while Carmike's stock soared 16% to $29.25.</p>              <p>Still, the offer may have undervalued Carmike, given the company's sway in smaller, regional markets, said B. Riley analyst Eric Wold. AMC's announcement could spark competing bids from Regal and No. 3 exhibitor Cinemark, he said.</p>              <p>""AMC is getting a bargain on an attractive asset,"" Wold said. ""The question is going to be, did Carmike shop this around already?""</p>              <p>The proposed tie-up is the latest example of consolidation in the movie theater industry. Carmike recently bought Robert Redford's Sundance Cinemas for $36 million in a deal encompassing five theaters, including the Sundance Sunset in West Hollywood. AMC last year took over 33-theater Starplex Cinemas in a deal worth $172 million. In 2013, Regal acquired Hollywood Theaters, a Portland, Ore., chain that operates 43 theaters in 16 states, for $191 million in cash and about $47 million in assumed lease obligations.</p>              <p>The concentration of the theater business comes at a time when exhibitors face long-term stagnation in attendance. Though the industry is coming off a record year at the box office, exhibitors continue to grapple with competition from other entertainment options, including streaming Internet video. Another problem is that the big Hollywood film companies are making fewer movies and focusing their efforts on their well-known franchises, forcing theater owners to increasingly rely on a few mega-hits a year to drive sales.</p>              <p>And unlike China's cinema industry, the U.S. theater business isn't building many new locations. Wold estimates the U.S. screen count has increased just 3% in the last decade.</p>              <p>""The problem is, domestically, there's no growth opportunity,"" Wold said. ""If you want to get scale and efficiency, you need to buy someone else.""</p>              <p>In recent years, major chains such as AMC have invested heavily in renovating and refurbishing their multiplexes with features such as upscale food, reclining seats and new sound and digital equipment to entice moviegoers. AMC is expected to make improvements to Carmike's theaters.</p>              <p>The deal would extend AMC's reach in smaller towns, suburban areas and rural regions where Carmike is a powerful player. AMC's influence, meanwhile, is mainly concentrated in major cities.</p>              <p>""Wherever you go, this deal is complementary,"" said AMC Chief Executive Adam Aron in an interview. ""We're strong in large cities, they're strong in smaller cities. We're strong in the Northeast, and they're strong in the Southeast. The addition of Carmike increases our scale and our scope and allows us to take the successes we've had and extend them to these additional theaters.""</p>              <p>The proposed pact is likely to face scrutiny from federal antitrust regulators, and analysts expect the combined company to divest some of its theaters in order to pass muster. The Justice Department last year ramped up an investigation into whether theater owners are violating federal law by preventing smaller rivals from playing movies at the same time.</p>              <p>--</p>              <p>ryan.faughnder@latimes.com</p>              <div><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""41""/><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""Illustration""/><div class=""Illustration_content""><p>Caption: PHOTO: AMC HAS made a $1.1-billion offer for Carmike Cinemas, the country's fourth-largest exhibitor.

""The bottom line is, Starwood wants to be with Marriott and I don't think the offer is high enough to start a bidding war.""</p>              <p>In addition to standard regulatory approvals, a deal between Anbang and Starwood would likely require a go-ahead from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., the same body that approved the company's purchase of the Waldorf Astoria.</p>              <p>""The key issue in any real estate deal or the purchase of any hotel is going to be proximity: Are the assets close to a sensitive government facility or installation?,"" said Anne W. Salladin, special counsel at the New York law firm of Stroock &amp; Stroock &amp; Lavan.

"120","2016-03-15","China's Takeover Surge Threatens Starwood Deal","1773150303","Wall Street Journal","A.1","            >                             </title>            >                          <p>A Chinese insurance giant lobbed in a roughly $13 billion bid for Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide Inc., an effort to break up the hotelier's pending sale to Marriott International Inc. and the latest sign of China's growing appetite for overseas takeovers.</p>              <p>The bid by Anbang Insurance Group Co. came just days after the insurer agreed to buy U.S. luxury hotel owner Strategic Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. from Blackstone Group LP for about $6.5 billion including debt. Less than two years ago, it struck a deal to purchase the historic Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan for nearly $2 billion.</p>              <p>Chinese companies have lately landed takeover agreements for everything from Swiss agriculture company Syngenta AG -- at $43 billion, the biggest such deal ever -- to General Electric Co.'s appliance unit and several semiconductor makers. In all, Chinese companies have agreed to $102 billion in foreign deals this year, nearly even with the record $106 billion for all of 2015, according to Dealogic. Anbang's deal for Starwood would represent China's biggest purchase of a U.S. company.</p>              <p>Analysts say the slowing Chinese economy is helping drive companies overseas, as Chinese companies seek higher-yielding assets and try to upgrade the country's industries. A weakening yuan also may be spurring companies to pursue deals before a further fall in the currency reduces their buying power overseas.</p>              <p>A representative from Anbang declined to comment.</p>              <p>Underscoring the ferocity of the push, a number of the takeover bids have been for companies that are already under contract with others. In January, for example, Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science &amp; Technology Co. said it offered to buy U.S. crane-maker Terex Corp. for about $3.3 billion, in an attempt by the Chinese company to bust up an existing deal between Terex and Finland's Konecranes Oyj. Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc. this year rejected a Chinese takeover bid after it had agreed to be bought by ON Semiconductor Corp. for $2.4 billion.</p>              <p>Several Chinese companies have expressed interest in Starwood since the hotel company announced last spring that it was exploring strategic alternatives. Lodging giant Shanghai Jin Jiang International Hotels Group Co., HNA Group, parent of Hainan Airlines Co., and the sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp. each presented separate proposals to the Chinese government seeking its approval for an approach before the Marriott deal was set, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>              <p>Chinese investors have sought to buy U.S. and European properties that stand to benefit from a boom in Chinese abroad.</p>              <p>There is no guarantee a Chinese deal for Starwood will materialize or that regulators would bless it. Indeed, there has been a groundswell of political opposition this year to Chinese takeovers. But heartening proponents of Anbang's bid for Starwood, U.S. authorities allowed the company's purchase of the high-profile Waldorf.</p>              <p>A group including Anbang offered to pay $76 a share in cash for Starwood, the owner of the Westin and Sheraton brands among others. That is a 7.9% premium to Starwood's closing stock price Friday. Marriott in November agreed to pay cash and stock for Starwood that was worth $63.74 as of Friday.</p>              <p>Shares of Starwood jumped 7.8% to $75.93 in 4 p.m. trading in New York, while Marriott rose 3% to $70.93.</p>              <p>Starwood is permitted to talk with rival bidders until March 17. Shareholders of Starwood and Marriott were scheduled to vote on the deal on March 28.</p>              <p>Marriott said Monday that it is committed to its deal for Starwood. The deal would create the No. 1 hotel company globally -- with more than one million rooms -- and bring together 30 brands across all lodging segments, from Starwood's higher-end W and St. Regis hotels to Marriott's limited-service offerings like Courtyard by Marriott and its extended-stay chain Residence Inn.</p>              <p>Once a provincial car insurer, Anbang has emerged from obscurity to become one of China's most aggressive overseas acquirers. The company has spent billions purchasing part or all of insurers in South Korea, Europe and the U.S., as well as taking stakes in listed Chinese developers, a bank, a traditional Chinese medicine maker and a wind turbine manufacturer. While it ranks outside the top 10 of Chinese insurers by premiums, the Beijing-based company has done nearly $28 billion worth of deals, according to Dealogic, with most of those acquisitions of foreign companies and coming in the past two years.</p>              <p>Anbang's chief executive, Wu Xiaohui, last year said his investment team had traveled the equivalent of a round trip journey from the Earth to the moon hunting for deals. ""We must win the first battle and every battle thereafter as we are representing Chinese enterprises going global,"" Mr. Wu told Harvard students in a speech.</p>              <p>To fund its ambitions, Anbang has turned to sales of high-yielding investment products, an unusual source for a Chinese insurer. In recent months, funds from sales of financial products to investors have outstripped cash taken in from its namesake insurance businesses, according to a review of company documents seen by The Wall Street Journal.</p>              <p>In the first three-quarters of 2015, Anbang Life raised 51.1 billion yuan ($7.9 billion) from selling the investment products, compared with 45.4 billion yuan in insurance premiums.</p>              <p>Anbang's partners in the bid include Primavera Capital Group and J.C. Flowers &amp; Co. Primavera is a China-based private-equity firm founded by Chinese deal maker Fred Hu, the former chairman for Greater China at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. A prominent investment banker and economist, Mr. Hu led Goldman's $2.9 billion deal to take a 5% stake in Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China Ltd.</p>              <p>Primavera was also an investor in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. before its initial public offering as part of a financing package raised to repurchase half of Yahoo Inc.'s stake in Alibaba.

The deal values Starwood's share at $79.53, according to Friday's closing prices.</p>              <p>Starwood stock closed at $80.57 on Friday after Anbang swooped in and raised its offer to a level Starwood called superior.

""And finally, we were helped by a modest recovery in our stock value in recent weeks, as the disconnect between stock performance and hotel fundamentals narrowed considerably.""</p>              <p>The higher cash offering, however, means Marriott will issue roughly 20 million, or 14%, fewer shares than the original agreement.</p>              <p>Under the new deal, the breakup fee that Starwood would pay if it chooses another suitor could be elevated in certain situations to $450 million from its previous $400 million level.</p>              <p>If that fee is triggered, Starwood would also be on the hook to pay Marriott as much as $18 million for costs related to financing the deal.</p>              <p>A person familiar with Anbang's thinking called the raise in the breakup fee ""very marginal"" and said it is indicative that Starwood is leaving the door open for Anbang to raise its offer again.</p>              <p>""The big question this week will be whether Anbang elects to increase its offer and drive a bidding war,"" said Canaccord analyst Ryan Meliker.

Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) launched a public broadside against China National Chemical Corp.'s planned deal, saying that the government must ensure that ""we're not permitting the sale of too much of our food industry, especially when government-controlled entities like ChemChina are the buyers.""</p>              <p>He said in an interview Wednesday that a bipartisan group of senators would seek a formal role for the U.S. Department of Agriculture as the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, carries out a national security review of the proposed ChemChina-Syngenta deal. Lawmakers want food security and safety implications analyzed, said Sen. Grassley said.</p>              <p>CFIUS is already expected to examine Syngenta's U.S. chemical plants that are potential terror targets, including some near military bases.</p>              <p>Syngenta, based in Switzerland, generates about one-quarter of its sales in North America, where it is a top pesticide seller and supplies an estimated 10% of U.S. soybean seeds and 6% for corn.</p>              <p>The lawmaker's comments raise a new threat to a deal that investors don't yet regard as a sure thing. The USDA has already expressed concerns over the deal's potential impact on the sector.</p>              <p>ChemChina struck a deal to buy Syngenta in February, extending a string of deal making among global giants in the $100 billion market for crop seeds and sprays. Agricultural companies are pursuing deals as they grapple with a three-year slide in major crop prices that has hit farmers' pocketbooks and forced seed makers to cut thousands of jobs.</p>              <p>""I'm not saying foreign direct investment is inherently bad,"" Mr. Grassley said in the interview.</p>              <p>""We need to consider the long-term implications of letting foreign entities control significant market share in U.S. agriculture, especially in consolidated markets, like the seed market has become,"" he said.</p>              <p>CFIUS is made up of representatives from 16 U.S. departments and agencies, including the Treasury, Homeland Security and Defense departments, but not including the USDA. CFIUS has a track record of scotching foreign companies' purchases of U.S. assets they think raise national-security risks.</p>              <p>Mr. Grassley said he and other senators want permanent roles on CFIUS for the USDA and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which are sometimes tapped to provide their views on mergers, and to evaluate food security and safety aspects of foreign-driven deals.</p>              <p>U.S. farm groups and agricultural companies also have complained that China's process for reviewing and approving agricultural products like genetically modified seeds is out of step with other major countries, leading to sometimes lengthy delays for high-tech seeds and trade disruptions.</p>              <p>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Thomas Vilsack said in February that the U.S. agricultural industry has grappled with ""inconsistency"" and ""lack of synchronization"" when it comes to securing China's approval to import new biotech crops in China, one of the world's top buyers of agricultural commodities.</p>              <p>""I have a watchful eye on all of this and continue to be extremely concerned about the way in which biotechnology and innovation is being treated and impeded by a system in China that often times is not based on science and appears to be based more on politics,"" Mr. Vilsack said in a conference call with reporters in February, responding to a question about the ChemChina-Syngenta deal.</p>              <p>A USDA spokeswoman declined to comment further.</p>              <p>A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, which chairs CFIUS, declined to comment.</p>              <p>Representatives for ChemChina and China's Ministry of Agriculture didn't respond to requests for comment. A Syngenta spokesman declined to comment on the CFIUS review.</p>              <p>Other farm-state lawmakers have their own reservations.</p>              <p>""Whenever the Chinese acquire American operations, it is reason for concern,"" said Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R., Neb.) in a recent statement to The Wall Street Journal. Rep. Adrian Smith, another Nebraska Republican, said in a statement to the Journal that there were ""still many details"" to examine. He added: ""I plan to look closely at any potential national security implications.""</p>              <p>Michel Demare, Syngenta's chairman, said in February that Syngenta doesn't expect preferential treatment by Chinese agricultural authorities, and that the ChemChina deal could help the Western seed industry by further opening the country to biotech crops, which currently permits cotton, papaya, sweet peppers and tomatoes.</p>              <p>""We are very convinced there is no security issue,"" Mr. Demare said.</p>              <p>Investors don't yet consider the deal a sure thing.</p>              <p>Syngenta shares on Wednesday climbed to 399.10 Swiss francs ($410.30) in European trading and have traded well below the offer, worth 480 francs a share, since the deal's announcement.</p>              <p>""[M]arket unwillingness to fully price in the deal appears to center on CFIUS,"" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a research note last month.</p>              <p>ChemChina and Syngenta voluntarily initiated the CFIUS review upon announcement of their deal. The formal review process typically takes 75 days. The companies expect to close the deal by the end of 2016.</p>              <p>As part of its review, CFIUS is expected to scrutinize Syngenta's chemical facilities that sit close to U.S. military sites, like one within about 10 miles of Offutt Air Force Base, located near Omaha and the headquarters of U.S. Strategic Command, where President George W. Bush headed following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.</p>              <p>Chinese companies increasingly are shopping abroad for acquisitions, putting more deals before CFIUS -- which sometimes blocks them.</p>              <p>Amsterdam-based Royal Philips NV in January abandoned the $2.8 billion sale of an 80% stake in its lighting-components unit to a Chinese investor after CFIUS blocked the deal on national-security grounds.

Later that day, following discussions between the two parties, the Anbang consortium raised its proposal to $82.75 a share.</p>              <p>Starwood said the new offer from Anbang, a Chinese insurance giant, is ""reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal."" Such a designation allows Starwood to engage in discussions and provide confidential information to the consortium.</p>              <p>Should Anbang succeed, the takeover would be the biggest Chinese purchase of a U.S. company ever. A representative from Anbang, which is partnering in the bid with private-equity firms J.C. Flowers &amp; Co. and Primavera Capital Group, declined to comment on Monday.</p>              <p>Marriott, which originally agreed to a deal with Starwood in November, last week boosted its bid to $79.53 a share in cash and stock, or $13.6 billion, as a result of competition from Anbang.</p>              <p>Some lodging analysts said Monday the Marriott may have run out of firepower.</p>              <p>""I think we've seen Marriott's last offer,"" said David Loeb, a hotel analyst at Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Issuing additional shares would be too dilutive, and borrowing to raise the cash portion of its bid likely would weigh on Marriott's credit rating, he said.</p>              <p>Still, Marriott could raise questions about Anbang's bid and the Chinese group's ability to close a deal.</p>              <p>Potentially foreshadowing such a strategy, Marriott in a statement on Monday said Starwood investors ""should give serious consideration to the question of whether the Anbang-led consortium will be able to close the proposed transaction, with a particular focus on the certainty of the consortium's financing and the timing of any required regulatory approvals.""</p>              <p>Marriott is likely ""coming back with this kind of rhetoric, rather than with more money,"" Mr. Loeb said.</p>              <p>""Marriott International will have no additional comment until further developments occur,"" a spokesman said.</p>              <p>In a potential sign of the difficult spot the company finds itself in, Marriott on Monday canceled an investor meeting scheduled for Tuesday in New York, at which Chief Executive Arne Sorenson was expected to make his case for a Starwood tie-up, according to someone who was notified of the move.</p>              <p>There is no guarantee regulators would approve a Chinese takeover of Starwood. There has been a surge of proposed Chinese takeovers in the U.S. this year, and it has been met by a groundswell of U.S. political opposition. People in Anbang's camp point to Anbang's roughly $2 billion purchase of the storied Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan less than two years ago, which American authorities allowed.</p>              <p>Chinese regulators could pick apart a deal as well. Just this month, Anbang agreed to buy U.S. luxury hotel owner Strategic Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. from Blackstone Group LP for about $6.5 billion, including debt. It isn't clear whether Chinese authorities would be comfortable with another aggressive acquisition push by the insurer.</p>              <p>Still, Starwood shareholders seemed to express optimism that a deal will get done, with the company's stock closing up 2% at $83.75 in New York trading on Monday.</p>              <p>Many Starwood shareholders are likely to prefer an all-cash bid at a time when hotel stocks have been volatile and recent terrorist attacks world-widewide could discourage overseas travel, some analysts said.</p>              <p>A number of Starwood shareholders are arbitrage funds who are ""not looking to hang around in Marriott stock,"" Mr. Loeb said. ""They are looking for the highest price.""</p>              <p>In a possible sign Marriott shareholders also would be pleased with that outcome, the company's shares increased 3.9% to $71.34 on Monday.</p>              <p>Marriott stands to collect a breakup fee exceeding $400 million should it lose Starwood to Anbang.</p>              <p>Marriott's counterbid last week was an unusually aggressive move for a company that historically has been conservative with its balance sheet. Chairman Bill Marriott typically has had an aversion to taking on too much debt, and the lodging company in the past has favored acquiring single-brand firms rather than pursuing splashy takeovers of rivals such as Starwood, with its 11 brands.</p>              <p>A combination of Starwood and Marriott -- the owner of Courtyard by Marriott and the extended-stay Residence Inn -- would create the world's No. 1 hotel chain with more than one million rooms and 30 brands.</p>              <p>Should the deal fall apart, Marriott would find itself in a closely contested battle with Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. for the distinction of being the largest hotel company by room count, with InterContinental Hotels Group PLC not far behind. Each company has more than 700,000 rooms world-wide, according to STR Inc.</p>              <p>When Marriott enhanced its bid last week, the offer valued Starwood's shares at $79.53 each. Under that revised deal, Starwood shareholders would receive $21 in cash and 0.8 Marriott share for each Starwood share.</p>              <p>The original agreement between the two companies valued Starwood at $72.08 a share. Earlier this month, the Anbang group offered $76 a share in cash and then bumped to $78.</p>              <p>On Monday, Marriott and Starwood each adjourned their respective stockholder meetings until April 8 to vote on the transaction. If approved by regulators and shareholders, the deal could close in mid 2016, the companies have said.</p>              <p>Credit: By Craig Karmin and Joshua Jamerson</p>                      "

Flowers &amp; Company and Primavera Capital, an investment firm led by a former chairman of Goldman Sachs for Asia -- Marriott decided earlier this week not to immediately raise its latest offer beyond roughly $13.25 billion, betting that something would befall the consortium's efforts.</p>              <p>That wager paid off. Combining Starwood with Marriott will create the biggest hotel company in the world, with more than 5,500 owned or franchised hotels and 1.1 million rooms.</p>              <p>Starwood said in a statement on Thursday that it had still managed to extract more money for the company's investors and looked forward to combining with Marriott.</p>              <p>""Throughout this process, we have been focused on maximizing stockholder value now and in the future,"" Bruce Duncan, Starwood's chairman, said. ""Our board is confident this transaction offers superior value for Starwood's stockholders, can close quickly and provides value-creation potential that will enable both sets of stockholders to benefit from future financial performance.""</p>              <p>Shares in Starwood fell more than 4 percent in after-hours trading after Anbang's disclosure, to $79.92. Shares in Marriott fell 5 percent, to $67.61.</p>              <p>What happened to Anbang's takeover effort is unclear. In a statement on Thursday, the insurer's consortium blamed unspecified ""various market considerations"" for its need to withdraw.</p>              <p>The abrupt withdrawal of the offer raised new questions, including whether the Chinese government, which has close ties with Anbang, had blocked the proposed transaction, or whether the insurer and its fellow bidders had run into issues with the financing for the deal.</p>              <p>It is a mysterious end to the pursuit by Anbang, a huge insurer that has risen to prominence in recent years, in part through audacious deal-making. The Chinese firm, which has assets of more than $291 billion, became a force in the luxury hotel business in less than two years after buying the likes of the Waldorf Astoria and the JW Marriott Essex House.</p>              <p>Its chairman, Wu Xiaohui, had begun to gain a reputation as a Chinese counterpart to Warren E. Buffett, his wealth compounding rapidly since founding the insurer in 2004.</p>              <p>Still, the company he oversees has been criticized for its unusually opaque corporate structure: Thirty-seven interlocking holding companies control over 93 percent of Anbang's shares, while two government-owned companies own the remainder.</p>              <p>Had Anbang won Starwood, its deal would have been the biggest takeover of an American target by a Chinese buyer, according to data from Dealogic.</p>              <p>Yet from the time Anbang publicly bid for the hotel chain, investors and analysts questioned whether the Chinese-led group could actually close on its offer.</p>              <p>Anbang sought to break up Starwood's first deal with Marriott by offering $76 a share in cash, going up to $78 a share, a proposal that people briefed on the discussions said was fully documented, meaning the financing was in place.</p>              <p>Marriott countered with a new cash-and-stock proposal on March 21 valued then at $79.53 a share, raising the prospect that the Chinese-led group would come back with an even higher bid.</p>              <p>Anbang and its partners indeed responded, by offering $81 a share and then $82.75 a share in cash. But the latest offer, which came last weekend, seemed on shakier grounds with its financing, according to people briefed on the matter.</p>              <p>Analysts said that Marriott would be hard-pressed to beat that price, since doing so could hurt its earnings per share.</p>              <p>But Marriott publicly questioned whether Anbang and its partners truly had the financing needed to close their offer, as well as how long American government regulators would take to bless the deal.</p>              <p>Another particular concern was whether a government panel focused on the national security aspects of mergers would require selling off Starwood properties near sensitive locations. The St. Regis Washington D.C., for example, is only blocks away from the White House, while a W hotel is near the Treasury Department.</p>              <p>Starwood and its advisers pressed the consortium for more information about financing and whether the Chinese government would bless the new proposal, these people said, requesting anonymity to discuss confidential negotiations.</p>              <p>People involved in the transaction spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>              <p>Publicly, Starwood noted on March 28 that while its board had determined that Anbang's second bid was ""reasonably likely to lead to a 'superior proposal,""' the new proposal was nonbinding and that the two sides needed to hammer out ""nonprice terms.""</p>              <p>The hotelier had been waiting several days for a response from the Chinese-led group when word first began to filter in early Thursday that Anbang and its partners were preparing to walk away, according to the people briefed on the matter.</p>              <p>Then around midafternoon on Thursday, Anbang's consortium sent Starwood's board a letter thanking them for their work but stating that it needed to walk away for unspecified market reasons.</p>              <p>No further reason was given.</p>              <div><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""39""/><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""Photograph""/><div class=""Photograph_content""><p>The W Hotel in Los Angeles, Owned by Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts.

Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science &amp; Technology is reminding investors of a more ordinary one: that Chinese firms abruptly terminates bids, for whatever reason.</p>              <p>Zoomlion scrapped its acquisition of U.S. equipment maker Terex on Friday. Recall that the Chinese machinery maker was the one who interrupted Terex's 2015 all-share merger with Finnish peer Konecranes by first offering cash valued at $30 a share and then $31 a share. That second $3.4 billion bid was about 60% higher than Konecranes's offer.</p>              <p>Terex responded this month by canceling the Konecranes merger and instead announcing a sale of only its port and industrial-crane segment to the Finns. That is the asset Konecranes wanted the most and the one whose political sensitivity may have created the biggest headache for Zoomlion. It seemed designed to make all parties happy. Yet Zoomlion says it couldn't agree with Terex ""on the crucial terms,"" without giving details.</p>              <p>One theory is that price suddenly emerged as a sore spot. After adjusting for the reduced value of Terex after its Konecranes side deal, Terex wanted a slightly higher offer because its side deal had avoided the need for paying Konecranes the termination fee the previous merger required, according to a person familiar with the situation. Zoomlion, on the other hand, wanted to offer slightly less due to tax complications as well as Terex's terrible first-quarter results.</p>              <p>If Zoomlion is balking over what might be less than $1 a share, this appears to be a pretext for re-examining what was always a rich deal. Zoomlion's $31 bid valued Terex at 22.8 times 2016 earnings during an equipment-industry downturn. At that valuation, compared with Terex's 10-year average of 15.7 times, it isn't surprising the buyer got cold feet.</p>              <p>Another theory is that Zoomlion, already heavily indebted, didn't get its financing in order. If so, being partly owned by a provincial Chinese government didn't provide a backstop.</p>              <p>Terex executives already seemed concerned about Zoomlion's financing. After announcing the Konecranes side deal, Terex gave Zoomlion two weeks to make a fully financed $31 bid for the whole company, including the port and crane segment, if it wanted to, likely an attempt to force the Chinese to line up the dollars.</p>              <p>Zoomlion's Hong Kong shares fell slightly on the deal's collapse. Its shareholders are worse off. They don't get access to Terex's world-class crane technology. Meanwhile, Konecranes shares rose 3.3% Friday. Investors perhaps sense that Terex could come back to discuss a full merger.</p>              <p>The surest loser is Terex. Coming a few months after Chinese insurer Anbang Insurance Group mysteriously dropped its bid for Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide, other acquisition targets might want to grill their Chinese suitors on whether they have the cash or are truly willing to pay the price.</p>              <p>Credit: By Abheek Bhattacharya</p>                      "

It moved a step closer to hitting the trifecta of broken deals this week, just days after a major Chinese construction-equipment maker bailed on its bid to buy U.S. crane maker Terex Corp.</p>              <p>Announced overseas deals by Chinese companies topped 2015's record before this year was half over, which would make China the world's biggest buyer of foreign companies for the first time ever, according to Dealogic. Chinese companies also have failed to close on more deals than ever before, according to Dealogic.</p>              <p>It isn't a coincidence that the boom in Chinese overseas deal making occurred while businesses and individuals were pouring cash overseas, either to avoid an expected depreciation of the yuan or just to get assets out of the reach of Beijing. And the recent failures have happened while Beijing acts to stem the flow of these funds.</p>              <p>That is just part of the weirdness that surrounds many of these deals, and their demise. Another is the opaque nature of the companies involved and the government owners or regulators that determine what is and isn't allowed. Last are the reasons behind the deals, which have foreign regulators on edge.</p>              <p>The latest deal on the ropes is Anbang's planned $1.57 billion acquisition of U.S. insurer Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Life, one of the biggest sellers of fixed-indexed annuities. Regulators in the U.S. have demanded but haven't received detailed financial information from Anbang. Fidelity says it expects Anbang will try again to get the deal approved.</p>              <p>It isn't surprising that the company hasn't provided the requested information. Efforts to figure out Anbang's corporate structure or where its cash came from have so far failed to yield much clarity. This is the third proposed Anbang deal to run into trouble. First was its effort to buy Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide Inc. After bidding up the price and threatening a rival deal, Anbang pulled out suddenly with little explanation.</p>              <p>Then came its effort to buy a group of Canadian hotels. After weeks of negotiating, Anbang told Toronto-based InnVest Real Estate Investment Trust it was no longer interested. Anbang's chief negotiator then helpfully introduced the executives to another possible buyer, this one with an even more obscure structure than Anbang. The deal was signed May 10. Days before the latest Anbang unwind, Zoomlion, one of China's biggest construction-equipment makers, pulled out of a $3.4 billion deal to buy Terex after failing to come up with a fully financed, binding proposal, Terex said.</p>              <p>Despite the headlines, China succeeds in most of its deals. Of the 50 biggest overseas deals it has struck since the start of 2015, just five have been formally withdrawn while 19 remain pending. Companies globally are pulling out of deals at a record pace this year, with U.S. companies accounting for the top three scuttled mergers. But in those cases, the deals were canceled over objections by regulators or changes in tax laws, not unilateral decisions by buyers.</p>              <p>The failed deals are an embarrassment to Beijing, which wants its businesses and financial system to wield the same clout globally as its huge economy. They also highlight the contradictions in China that will keep that from happening.</p>              <p>The most obvious is the Chinese currency, the yuan. Chinese officials know that a weaker yuan will boost the country's economy, but signs of weakness have at times led to capital flight. In the past month, though, Beijing has been able to both devalue the currency to its lowest level in five years and stem capital flight. It is unclear whether the busted deals were casualties of that effort.</p>              <p>Another contradiction lies in China's opaque corporate and regulatory structures. Skepticism runs so high that foreign targets of Chinese companies such as U.S. computer distributor Ingram Micro Inc. have forced bidders to put down deposits that sit outside of China in the event the deals don't close.</p>              <p>Then there is the tight link between Chinese companies and the government. Beijing wants to build important industries such as semiconductors and agriculture via acquisitions, which sends a clear message to foreign governments that the deals aren't being done for purely economic reasons.</p>              <p>At least one chip deal failed because of regulatory concerns. The big test for now is China National Chemical Corp.'s $43 billion offer for Swiss seed maker Syngenta AG, which would be by far the biggest overseas Chinese acquisition ever. Already there is opposition in the U.S.</p>              <p>That deal is important because it fits with China's need to acquire sophisticated expertise in areas such as tech and health care. Other deals like Terex might have helped China shift some of its excess capacity overseas.</p>              <p>Failed acquisitions make targets and regulators more skeptical.

"136","2016-08-02","COMPANY TOWN; Imax accelerates its expansion into China","1807979007","Los Angeles Times","C.1","            >                             </title>            >                          <p>Big-screen cinema company Imax Corp. is taking a major step to expand its footprint in China by deepening its ties with the country's largest cinema operator, Wanda Cinema Line.</p>              <p>Toronto-based Imax said Tuesday that it had signed an agreement with a subsidiary of conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group to add 150 theaters to its circuit during the next six years. Currently, Wanda operates about 160 Imax theaters in the country.</p>              <p>""It's the biggest deal in the company's 50-year history,"" Imax Chief Executive Rich Gelfond said in an interview. ""The growth is just accelerating.""</p>              <p>The pact represents the latest example of Hollywood's push into China, which is expected to surpass the U.S. and Canada as the world's largest film market as soon as 2017. The Chinese film business has exploded in recent years thanks to a rising middle class and substantial government support, growing nearly 50% to $6.8 billion last year.</p>              <p>Imax has been a major player in China's film business for about a decade, and is investing significantly to grow its presence there. Audiences in China have displayed a healthy appetite for the kinds of big, spectacle-based blockbusters such as ""Captain America: Civil War"" that work best in premium Imax format.</p>              <p>Imax also was a beneficiary of a landmark agreement in 2012 when China expanded the number of foreign movies it allows into the country under a revenue- sharing agreement. Under the deal, China agreed to allow an additional 14 premium format films in the country, up from 20.</p>              <p>In another sign of Imax's bet on the growing market, the company's China subsidiary went public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in October. Although investors responded tepidly at first, Imax China shares are up about 30% from their initial public offering price.</p>              <p>Wanda Cinema Line was one of Imax's original exhibition partners in China, opening a theater in Dongguan in 2007. The companies then signed a 75-theater joint venture deal in 2011, and in 2013 agreed to open additional theaters.</p>              <p>Worldwide, Imax has more than 1,100 theaters, 335 of which are open in China. With the new deal, Imax now has commitments to add 407 Chinese theaters in the coming years, including those from Wanda and other Chinese theater chains.</p>              <p>""Imax is big there and 3-D is big there, and that's where a lot of the box-office bump has been coming from,"" said Stanley Rosen, a USC political science professor who is an expert on China's ties with Hollywood. ""[Imax] certainly sees China as their big market, with the U.S. being flat.""</p>              <p>Wanda, the media and real estate giant run by billionaire Wang Jianlin, has been making film industry deals at a brisk pace to bolster its entertainment business and establish itself as a global player.</p>              <p>On Monday, the company inked a deal with Beverly Hills-based technology provider RealD to add 4,000 3-D projection systems to its cinema circuit. The additional RealD systems that will be installed during the next four years as part of the deal will grow its Wanda footprint to 5,600 screens.</p>              <p>""Our RealD-equipped theaters have been a significant part of our growth strategy,"" Xiaobin Liu, executive president of Wanda Cinema Line, said in a statement.</p>              <p>China's box office surpassed $4 billion in the first half of this year, up 21% from the same time in 2015, according to film industry consulting firm Artisan Gateway. Although that's a slower pace of growth than in recent years, it's still a sizable increase at a time when U.S. theater-growing is largely stagnant.</p>              <p>Much of the slower growth in ticket sales in China is because of the spectacular grosses for 2015 movies like ""Furious 7"" and ""Jurassic World."" Nonetheless, the numbers have raised concerns about a broader slowdown in China.</p>              <p>""The second quarter of Chinese box office was slow compared to a year ago, and people are concerned about that,"" Gelfond said. ""I still think the Chinese box office is on a very torrid pace.""</p>              <p>Imax has been an important partner for Hollywood studios trying to take advantage of the box-office trends in China. The video game adaptation ""Warcraft,"" which bombed in the U.S., did huge business in that country, generating record-breaking first day ticket sales in Imax theaters.</p>              <p>In addition to standard Hollywood fare, Imax has shown Chinese films such as ""Mojin: The Lost Legend"" and ""Monkey King 2"" in its theaters, and local language movies have become a bigger business for the company. The Chinese Imax subsidiary is co-financing local movies.</p>              <p>The China-Hollywood relationship will face a major test with this year's release of ""The Great Wall,"" a big-budget Chinese-American co-production starring Matt Damon that is set to get a big Imax release.</p>              <p>Wanda has been leading a wave of global consolidation of the entertainment industry, having acquired ""Warcraft"" and ""The Great Wall"" producer Legendary Entertainment this year for $3.5 billion. ""Warcraft"" clearly benefited from the market clout of Wanda, which heavily promoted the movie in the country.</p>              <p>Wanda also owns AMC Entertainment, the second-largest U.S. theater circuit, for which it paid $2.6 billion in 2012.</p>              <p>AMC is trying to buy smaller rival Carmike Cinemas in a deal valued at $1.2 billion, including debt. AMC is poised to become the world's largest cinema owner once it completes another $1.2-billion deal to acquire London-based Odeon &amp; UCI Cinemas Group.</p>              <p>In addition, Wanda has recently been in talks to buy 49% of Paramount Pictures from the storied studio's parent company, Viacom Inc. Such a transaction, though, would be complicated by the conflict raging between Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman, who is pushing for the transaction, and controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone, who opposes such a deal.</p>              <p>--</p>              <p>ryan.faughdner@latimes.com</p>              <div><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""41""/><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""Illustration""/><div class=""Illustration_content""><p>Caption: PHOTO: IMAX HAS been an important partner for Hollywood studios trying to take advantage of the box-office trends in China.

Swiss-based Syngenta generates about one-quarter of its sales from North America.</p>              <p>""They've not yet reached the point where they have found an acquisition in the food and agriculture sector to threaten national security,"" said Stephen McHale, a partner at Squire Patton Boggs who has helped shepherd deals through the CFIUS process. The body's rulings reflect a view that the U.S. is ""very secure in its food supply.""</p>              <p>But CFIUS has emerged as a key hurdle for Chinese firms looking to acquire technologies.</p>              <p>While CFIUS itself can't reject deals, if national-security concerns are found, the body can recommend that companies modify their deal or divest U.S. assets. It can also recommend that the U.S. president block the deal, though typically companies will abandon transactions before then. CFIUS has the ability to review any deals that result in change of control of a business operating in the U.S., even if it is part of a company based abroad.</p>              <p>In January, Philips NV said it would drop a $2.8 billion deal to sell its Lumileds LED lightbulb business to an investment fund led by Chinese venture-capital firm GSR Ventures, following undisclosed concerns from CFIUS.</p>              <p>Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc. opted in February to turn down a bid from China Resources Microelectronics Ltd. and Hua Capital Management Co. in favor of an existing deal to be bought by Arizona-based ON Semiconductor Corp. Fairchild cited the risk of a failure to obtain CFIUS approval.</p>              <p>Also in February, Western Digital Corp. said Beijing-based Unisplendour Corp. terminated a plan to buy a 15% stake in the disk drive maker for $3.78 billion after the committee informed the companies it would investigate the transaction.</p>              <p>CFIUS includes representatives from 16 U.S. departments and agencies, including the Treasury, Homeland Security and Defense departments.</p>              <p>Its approval of the ChemChina-Syngenta deal, as well as the 2013 sale of U.S. pork giant Smithfield Foods Inc. to China's WH Group Ltd., suggests a different view of the technology that goes into breeding and processing hogs for pork chops and developing corn plants capable of repelling pests, say lawyers familiar with the CFIUS process.</p>              <p>Syngenta and ChemChina announced the CFIUS approval Monday but didn't comment on any conditions required by the committee. A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department declined to comment on the Syngenta deal or CFIUS's attitude toward China.</p>              <p>Erik Fyrwald, Syngenta's chief executive, said the deal would benefit farmers and crop production globally by placing Syngenta under ownership of a deep-pocketed company that will support long-term investments in research. ""The interests of China and U.S. agriculture are aligned in this deal,"" he said.</p>              <p>Some lawmakers and farm groups continued to warn on Monday of longer-range threats to U.S. agriculture as China -- among the world's top buyers of agricultural commodities -- absorbs more of the technology that has made the U.S. the largest global producer of corn, soybeans, beef and chicken meat.</p>              <p>Bringing Syngenta into the portfolio of ChemChina is also expected to spur China's adoption of genetically modified crops and other agricultural advances as the country strives to become more food secure.</p>              <p>""The fact that a state-owned enterprise may have yet another stake in U.S. agriculture is alarming,"" said Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa). Mr. Grassley in July introduced a bill that seeks a permanent spot on CFIUS for the U.S. Department of Agriculture to scrutinize deals for food-security threats, and in April joined other senators calling for deeper scrutiny of the ChemChina-Syngenta deal.</p>              <p>Some U.S. farm groups remained cautious that ownership under ChemChina could give Syngenta advantages over rivals in China. The country is a potentially massive market for agricultural products that has yet to fully allow foreign-based firms to compete domestically, and which has yet to embrace genetically engineered crops.</p>              <p>Chinese firms have struck about $160 billion worth of foreign takeover deals so far this year, far greater than any full year on record, according to Dealogic.</p>              <p>Approval from CFIUS may not mean that ChemChina's deal for Syngenta is free and clear. The transaction still requires approval by antitrust authorities in the European Union and the U.S. who will examine the combination of Syngenta and ChemChina, given ChemChina's ownership in Israeli pesticide manufacturer Adama Agricultural Solutions Ltd.</p>              <p>Lawmakers could also keep up pressure on the deal. When Dubai Ports World in 2005 moved to buy U.S. shipping ports on the East Coast, CFIUS initially approved the transaction, but a campaign by U.S. senators and others concerned about national security later led to the deal's collapse.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Don Clark contributed to this article.</p>              <p>Credit: By Jacob Bunge, Brian Spegele and William Mauldin</p>                      "

In 2012, Wanda bought AMC Theaters, the large American chain, for $2.6 billion.</p>              <p>""Should the definition of national security be broadened to address concerns about propaganda and control of the media and 'soft power' institutions?"" the representatives said in the letter, which was dated Sept. 15 and addressed to Gene L. Dodaro, comptroller general.</p>              <p>Mr. Dodaro is the head of the Government Accountability Office, and the aim of the letter was to urge that office to consider whether the government process to review foreign investment in the United States needs to be expanded. The process is overseen by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, an interagency group that is supervised by the Treasury Department.</p>              <p>""As we prepare for the upcoming presidential transition, now is an opportune time for G.A.O. to review what has worked well, and where Cfius authorities may need to be expanded, especially given the rise in state-controlled enterprises from China and Russia, among other designated countries,"" the letter said.</p>              <p>Wanda is not a state-controlled enterprise, but the writers said that any Chinese company designated a ""state champion"" that benefits from ""illegal subsidies"" could pose a strategic, if not overt, national security threat. They said there have been ""growing concerns about China's efforts to censor topics and exert propaganda controls on American media.""</p>              <p>The letter also pointed to the $43 billion purchase of Syngenta, a Swiss company specializing in seeds and farm chemicals, by the state-owned China National Chemical Corporation as another transaction that had raised ""concern"" in Congress. That deal was approved by the committee in August.</p>              <p>In a list of nine questions at the end of the letter, the signers also asked whether the committee sufficiently reviews Chinese angel or venture capital funds being established in the United States, as well as Chinese investment in technology accelerators and regulators.</p>              <p>In February, Steven Davidoff Solomon, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in The New York Times that some bids for foreign businesses by Chinese companies were canceled after scrutiny by the committee. While it approves most transactions, he wrote, we should ""expect tensions to get worse"" since Chinese companies are increasingly investing in foreign companies as a way of moving money out of China.</p>              <p>""We are entering into a new phase with Chinese acquisitions,"" Mr. Solomon wrote. ""The United States' national security service, never considered a transparent process, is going to have to grapple with how far it can allow these Chinese companies to go.""</p>              <p>Among the signers of the Sept. 15 letter are some well-known critics of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>              <p>Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, introduced a bill in 2012 that called for the government to withhold visas for Chinese journalists if Beijing continued its policy of not issuing such documents to American journalists or news organizations that it deemed to be troublemakers. Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey, speaks out regularly against human rights abuses in China.</p>              <p>""Beijing is increasingly confident that its version of state authoritarianism can be exported, though the Communist Party's efforts at 'soft power' outreach have little credibility or impact at this point,"" Mr. Smith said in a written statement to The Times on Wednesday.</p>              <p>""But the buying spree by Dalian Wanda Group and other Chinese investments in Hollywood, media and entertainment should raise questions that restrictions on creative freedom or media self-censorship will follow, particularly when Dalian Wanda's C.E.O. is very clear that his goal is to subvert American pop culture's influence and change the world where rules are set by foreigners,"" he said.</p>              <p>""Would any movies favorably portraying the Dalai Lama, Liu Xiaobo or Chen Guangcheng be greenlighted if they risked the loss of Chinese investment -- I don't think so,"" he added, referring to three people deemed prominent political adversaries by the Communist Party.</p>              <p>Wanda declined to comment on Friday.</p>              <p>On Wednesday, Wang Jianlin, Wanda's chairman and founder, told CNN that he thought the American lawmakers were ""over-worried.""

But after working for months to get skeptical investors on board, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. appears poised to win shareholder approval for an acquisition that would make it the largest exhibitor in the world.</p>              <p>AMC, which is the second-biggest theater chain in the U.S., plans to pay $1.2 billion to acquire Carmike Cinemas Inc., a tie-up that Carmike shareholders are expected to vote on Tuesday. The initial deal, announced in March, was met with investor backlash and forced a delay of the vote.</p>              <p>Meanwhile, AMC Chief Executive Adam Aron is pursuing a second acquisition that would expand the company to Europe. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year.</p>              <p>""Two acquisitions at the same time,"" said Mr. Aron in a recent interview. ""We have a capital expenditure for each, so we need to make sure we raise the funds.""</p>              <p>AMC's deals -- the $650 million purchase of Europe's Odeon &amp; UCI Cinemas Group, in addition to the Carmike acquisition -- are expected to take AMC's theatrical footprint to about 900 locations, from about 388. Its stateside merger with Carmike, currently the nation's No. 4 exhibitor with 273 theaters, is considered the largest possible tie-up in exhibition that would pass Justice Department scrutiny.</p>              <p>The deal combines AMC, an urban-centric chain that has drawn attention for its recent state-of the-art auditorium renovations, with Carmike, which largely has operated lower-cost multiplexes in rural parts of the country.</p>              <p>It has been a long eight months for AMC, majority-owned by Beijing-based Dalian Wanda Group Co., since the Carmike deal was announced. Shareholder blowback to the initial offer -- $30 a share in a $1.1 billion deal -- forced the company to delay votes on the acquisition, and political opposition began mounting because of AMC's Chinese ownership.</p>              <p>But now that AMC has come back with an offer of $33.06 a share and some AMC stock, enough support is expected to win shareholder approval, according to people familiar with the matter. The improved terms helped persuade some major investors and proxy advisory firms to reverse course and endorse the deal.</p>              <p>New shareholders who have come on board since the initial offer also are helping to muster enough votes to complete the deal, say people familiar with the matter.</p>              <p>Several investment firms specializing in arbitrage bets have bought into Carmike since March and now appear likely to see short-term gains because of the sweetened terms. They include Magnetar Financial LLC and Driehaus Capital Management LLC, which didn't have Carmike stock a month before the acquisition's announcement but is now the company's largest shareholder, with a stake of just under 10%.</p>              <p>Those late-arriving shareholders have annoyed investors such as Chris Mittleman, whose Mittleman Brothers LLC is Carmike's second-largest shareholder with a 9.5% stake. He said his firm would vote against the deal.</p>              <p>Among his grievances: Carmike didn't shop itself around to other companies that could have run up the bid, and a premium should be offered because Carmike represents the biggest possible company that AMC likely could acquire under antitrust rules. Irate about AMC's valuation of Carmike, Mr. Mittleman argued that $40 a share was a minimum fair value. Carmike declined to comment.</p>              <p>Resistance to the deal also has come from Washington, D.C., operative Richard Berman, a lobbyist who has waged a campaign against AMC's controlling stakeholder, Wanda. Even if the deal goes through, Mr. Berman said he would battle Chinese intrusion into U.S. media holdings.</p>              <p>Mr. Aron rejected the claim that Wanda controlled the operations of AMC.</p>              <p> </p>              <p> </p>              <p><object class=""mstar_link_to_media""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""6""/><param name=""mstar_lm_alignment"" value=""Left""/><param name=""mstar_lm_display_control"" value=""Embed""/><param name=""mstar_lm_pred_equation"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_type"" value=""Illustration""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_id"" value=""1""/></object></p>              <p>Credit: By Erich Schwartzel</p>                      "

The move increases the likelihood of a re-examination of how the U.S. allows the nation to invest in American companies.</p>              <p>""I am concerned that these acquisitions reflect the strategic goals of China's government,"" he told Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman in the letter, a copy of which was seen by The Wall Street Journal.</p>              <p>Wanda and its U.S.-based holdings have completed several entertainment acquisitions this year, and the conglomerate has a pending deal to buy Dick Clark Productions for $1 billion.</p>              <p>Mr. Trump, who has indicated his administration will also take a closer look at such deals, was copied on the letter.</p>              <p>If the president-elect follows through on promises to scrutinize such deals more closely, Mr. Schumer's letter could signal a shift for U.S. policy toward China. For decades, some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been unhappy with the White House, both under President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, whom they saw as timid about confronting China, the biggest holder of U.S. debt.</p>              <p>Now, a senior Democratic lawmaker and the incoming Republican U.S. president could be on the same side of the issue, potentially shaking up the landscape. Congressional backlash to foreign investments have lately focused on flashy Hollywood deals, but the outcry could have sweeping ramifications across other sectors of the economy, and produce a chilling effect for overseas investors.</p>              <p>""You can be certain that the new Congress in 2017 will work on legislation to further expand CFIUS oversight authority,"" Mr. Schumer wrote, referring to the Treasury Department's Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which examines foreign deals seen as potential threats to national security. CFIUS reviews have traditionally concerned sectors like aerospace.</p>              <p>Wanda has previously responded to similar calls for scrutiny by saying the company ""has and will continue to comply with all applicable U.S. law in connection with its media and entertainment investments in the United States, including without limitation making the appropriate filings with the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice.""</p>              <p>Wanda declined to comment on Mr. Schumer's letter.</p>              <p>Mr. Schumer's stance aligns the Democrat on one issue with the president-elect. A document circulated by Mr. Trump's transition team stated that the administration would ask CFIUS to review foreign transactions that couldn't be replicated by a U.S. entity. That could cover Chinese investment far beyond Hollywood, since Chinese companies can become majority owners of U.S. assets but China doesn't allow U.S. companies to do the same.</p>              <p>Mr. Schumer said the ability for Chinese companies to take a majority stake in U.S. assets, often backed by state officials and China's sovereign-wealth funds, is unfair considering stateside companies are handicapped from doing similar deals in China. U.S. companies hoping to do business in China usually have to form a joint venture that often includes the sharing of intellectual property -- an arrangement that Mr. Schumer called a ""pay to play system.""</p>              <p>""While China's government has aggressively pursued policies that encourage strategic acquisition in the U.S., U.S. companies continue to face steep barriers to market access in China,"" he wrote. Mr. Schumer said Chinese acquisitions across multiple sectors -- information technology, transportation, manufacturing and agriculture, among others -- are often supported by Chinese government subsidies designed to encourage global expansion.</p>              <p>Like several politicians before him, Mr. Schumer set his sights on Wanda, whose chairman, Wang Jianlin, is China's richest man, according to Forbes. In a speech in Los Angeles in October, Mr. Wang said he isn't motivated by government agendas. ""I am a businessman,"" he said.</p>              <p>Wanda's acquisitions in Hollywood have raised concerns among politicians and some entertainment executives that they are ""soft power"" plays designed to spread Chinese culture and messaging through American media.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Brody Mullins contributed to this article.</p>              <p>Credit: Erich Schwartzel, Siobhan Hughes</p>                      "

"148","2017-03-11","COMPANY TOWN; $1-billion deal falls through; It was price -- and maybe politics -- that derailed the sale of Dick Clark Productions to China's Dalian Wanda Group","1876000595","Los Angeles Times","C.1","> highly publicized $1-billion deal to sell Dick Clark Productions to China's Dalian Wanda Group has collapsed, marking one of the biggest of many deals between China and Hollywood to fall by the wayside.</p><p>Dick Clark Productions owner Eldridge Industries said Friday that it had called off the blockbuster agreement after Wanda, which announced plans to purchase the TV production company in November, failed to complete the sale.</p><p>The acquisition of Dick Clark Productions, which produces the Golden Globe Awards, Academy of Country Music Awards and ""Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve With Ryan Seacrest,"" would have been Wanda's first foray into television, adding to its formidable arsenal of film and cinema assets.</p><p></p><p>But Wanda, and the Chinese government, ultimately balked at the hefty purchase price promised to Dick Clark Productions, according to multiple people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to comment.</p><p>The failed acquisition is a setback for Wanda and its billionaire chairman, Wang Jianlin, who has been one of the most aggressive Chinese players in the global entertainment industry. Wanda owns the world's largest theater chain, AMC Theatres, as well as large cinema circuits in China and Europe, and has been willing to pay significant premiums for entertainment and sports companies. Now, however, there appears to be a limit on what it will spend to add a piece to its empire.</p><p>""The Chinese government is forcing Chinese companies to pay more attention to price, which is a good thing,"" said Marc Ganis, co-founder and managing director of Jiaflix Enterprises, which helps studios distribute movies in China. ""This is part of the process of the maturation of Chinese capital markets. It brings a little more rationality to the business.""</p><p>Eldridge, the investment firm run by Todd Boehly, accused Wanda of failing ""to honor its contractual obligations,"" and filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court seeking payment of its $25-million breakup fee in addition to the $25 million Wanda already paid to extend the transaction's closing date.</p><p>Representatives for Wanda declined to comment.</p><p>The scuttled pact represents another stumble for Wanda as it tries to advance its Hollywood ambitions beyond owning movie theaters and Legendary Entertainment, which backed the ""Dark Knight"" and ""Hangover"" movies. The Beijing real estate and entertainment giant tried to buy 49% of Paramount Pictures last year, but controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone and his daughter Shari Redstone nixed the idea. Wanda has also been trying to lure U.S. producers to its $8.2-billion moviemaking and entertainment complex in Qingdao, China, though it's not clear how many will take the bait.</p><p>Compounding matters, Legendary Entertainment, the Burbank production company Wanda bought for $3.5 billion last year, has been hit with recent box-office disappointments including ""The Great Wall"" and ""Warcraft."" Legendary Chairman and Chief Executive Thomas Tull resigned in January, leaving Wanda cultural industries executive Jack Gao in charge as its interim CEO.</p><p>Insiders had long speculated that the Dick Clark Productions deal was on shaky footing. There had been growing concerns within Wanda and the government that the company would be vastly overpaying for Dick Clark Productions. A group of investors led by Guggenheim Partners bought it for $380 million less than five years ago.</p><p>Wanda had also hoped that buying Dick Clark Productions would give the Chinese company control of popular awards shows, including the Golden Globes. But the reality proved to be more complicated. Although Dick Clark Productions has the rights to produce the ceremony for television, the awards themselves are controlled by the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn., limiting Wanda's influence.</p><p>""The question on the Wanda side is, how did they let it get so far down the line before it fell apart?"" said a film industry executive with ties to China who asked not to be named to protect business relationships.</p><p>Political factors probably contributed to the eventual collapse of the transaction. There is growing pressure on both countries' regulators to more heavily scrutinize major cross-border acquisitions and investments.</p><p>Protectionist rhetoric by the Trump administration and Washington lawmakers has added to the anxiety over U.S.-China dealmaking. Last month, President Trump called the Chinese the ""grand champions"" of currency manipulation, and during his presidential campaign threatened to levy tariffs on Chinese goods. Several prominent politicians including Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) have called on regulators to be wary of Chinese investment in U.S. industries, singling out Wanda's entertainment investments.</p><p>""The hit to their credibility and the multifaceted attacks they are facing make this a challenging time for Wanda and Wang Jianlin,"" said Stanley Rosen, a USC political science professor and China expert.</p><p>Chinese officials, fearful last year of falling currency values, tightened restrictions on capital leaving the world's second-largest economy. The government stepped up oversight of foreign acquisitions and tried to curb ""irrational"" outbound investments. That made it harder for firms to receive permission to transfer yuan and close deals.</p><p>Though Chinese policymakers generally favor diversifying the nation's wealth overseas, they have grown concerned over the pace of outflows. China needs a sizable stash of foreign reserves to stabilize its currency and meet benchmarks set by the International Monetary Fund. China's recent crackdown on capital flight appears to be working. Its foreign reserves rose in February for the first time in eight months after dipping to their lowest level in nearly six years.</p><p>The government clampdown has far-reaching implications for Chinese companies looking to invest in the U.S. entertainment industry. Regulatory issues recently resulted in Chinese copper company Anhui Xinke New Materials scrapping plans to buy ""The Hurt Locker"" producer Voltage Pictures for $350 million.</p><p>The Chinese government actions are also said to have put the brakes on Shanghai Film Group and Huahua Media's plan to invest up to $1 billion in Paramount Pictures' film slate over several years. The Chinese investors are also looking for more details on Paramount's turnaround plan and search for new leadership, according to people close to the companies. The crackdown also reportedly derailed talks to sell storied film and TV studio MGM to a Chinese company last year.</p><p>But while the capital controls are problematic for smaller companies with few foreign holdings, they shouldn't be an issue for a corporate giant like Wanda, which has a web of business interests overseas. The firm is still expected to pursue entertainment acquisitions and has long held ambitions to own a full-fledged studio.</p><p>""Wanda is one of the most global Chinese companies and already has billions of dollars in overseas assets,"" said Thilo Hanemann, an economist for Rhodium Group, a research firm. ""Those have significant foreign currency cash flow and they can serve as collateral for debt financing. Wanda should be able to get that deal done if it really wants to, despite Chinese capital controls.""</p><p>--</p><p>ryan.faughnder@latimes.com</p><p>david.pierson@latimes.com</p><p>Staff writer Meg James contributed to this report.</p><p>Caption: PHOTO: LAST YEAR, Wanda Group, led by Chairman Wang Jianlin, center, bought Burbank production company Legendary Entertainment for $3.5 billion.

The afterparty had sweet-and-sour chicken.</p>              <p>The movie's poor showing didn't slow the trans-Pacific collaboration. Hollywood has become so entangled with China that the movie industry can't run without it.</p>              <p>Chinese investors and more than a billion potential moviegoers have made China indispensable to the film business. The country's box-office total last year, at $6.6 billion, was the world's second-largest compared with the first-place U.S., $11.4 billion. In a few years, analysts predict, China will be No. 1.</p>              <p>While the U.S. movie-ticket sales have remained relatively flat, China's have more than tripled since 2011.</p>              <p>""We never thought of China 10 years ago. Now, we're at a point where Hollywood can't exist without China,"" said Adam Goodman, a former production chief at Paramount Pictures. He now runs a film-production company backed by Le Eco, a Beijing-based technology company.</p>              <p>Private and state-backed Chinese companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in U.S. film ventures over the past decade. The relationship comes with strings attached. Chinese authorities, censors and consumers influence nearly every aspect of American moviemaking in China, from scripts to casting to greenlighting sequels.</p>              <p>""We're in a moment of significant disruption,"" said Richard Lovett, president of Creative Artists Agency, which represents such clients as Sandra Bullock and J.J. Abrams. The firm announced Monday it was expanding its footprint in the country with a division called CAA China.</p>              <p>China's ambition befits the big screen -- to compete with the U.S. as a global storyteller and spread its perspective in the same fashion American filmmakers have for a century.</p>              <p>The U.S. dominated the movie industry from the start, with its stories of heroism, romance and adventure. Over the years, it has drawn investors from Wall Street, Japan and Germany who appeared more starry-eyed over movie premieres than profits. Hollywood executives called it dumb money.</p>              <p>China, seen as the next sucker, instead proved an exceptional student. Its companies formed partnerships with Hollywood studios to learn about plotlines and character development, as well as soundtracks and visual effects -- similar to how it uncovered the secrets of semiconductors and aircraft engines.</p>              <p>""They think they can make money, but they're also engaged in knowing every bit of the building blocks to jump-start [on] the U.S.'s hundred-year advantage,"" said John Penotti, a producer and founder at SK Global, a film finance and production company with offices in Los Angeles and China that is backed by the China Cultural and Entertainment Fund, a private-equity group.</p>              <p>In November, China passed the U.S. in the number of movie theaters -- the most in the world -- adding screens at the rate of more than 25 a day. Some are the first theaters in small towns, drawing a new generation of fans.</p>              <p>China's movie box office dipped slightly last year. Even so, Mr. Penotti said, ""Social and cultural habits are being formed. It's like the U.S. in the 1950s.""</p>              <p>China flexed its box-office power this past weekend, when ""The Fate of the Furious"" opened to $99 million in the U.S. and Canada -- and $192 million in China, the biggest Hollywood opening ever in the country.</p>              <p>Chinese investors bring the support of a Communist Party that under China's leader, President Xi Jinping, has made cultural influence an important piece of its long-term growth plans.</p>              <p>""We must make patriotism into the main melody of literature and art creation, guide the people to establish and uphold correct views of history, views of the nation, views of the country and views of culture, and strengthen their fortitude and resolve to be Chinese,"" said Mr. Xi at the Beijing Forum on Literature and Art in October 2014.</p>              <p>Tensions between China and the White House have accelerated since the presidential election. Mr. Xi is seeking to strike a contrast with President Donald Trump as a champion of globalism, and he appears eager to advance China's narrative -- both by pressuring Hollywood studios to portray the nation favorably and, in the long term, by adopting Western filmmaking techniques for China's own movie industry.</p>              <p>Like a movie plot, China's rise was driven by conflict -- in this instance, the financial crisis. Hollywood's Wall Street financing dried up in 2008; U.S. movie-theater attendance stagnated; DVD sales, once a studio cash cow, slumped with the growth of streaming services, including Netflix Inc.</p>              <p>Around this time, China began an effort to introduce itself to the world as a cultural force with the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing as its opening act. Chinese officials announced investments of hundreds of billions of dollars to urbanize the country, transforming farmland into urban grids that included new, high-tech movie theaters. The seats began filling with members of China's new middle class, a generation born under the one-child policy who had disposable income and an appetite for Western entertainment. Like other young people, they also wanted an excuse to get out of the house.</p>              <p>""I remember talking to Chinese citizens, hearing that they liked American movies, and the Chinese authorities knew that,"" said Dan Glickman, chief executive of the Motion Picture Association of America from 2004 to 2010.</p>              <p>China, however, wanted more than Hollywood movies on its new screens. Authorities wanted Chinese filmmakers producing movies for Chinese audiences that would compete with the U.S. imports.</p>              <p>That desire got a push from a Hollywood panda named Po. The animated star of ""Kung Fu Panda"" was created by DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc., the Glendale, Calif., studio then run by Jeffrey Katzenberg.</p>              <p>Mr. Katzenberg didn't cook up ""Panda"" to win over Chinese audiences. He and the DreamWorks team conceived of the movie in 2004, when China sales were barely an afterthought. At its 2008 release, China's market was small but growing.</p>              <p>Yet ""Kung Fu Panda"" was a hit in China, grossing $26 million, a surprise to everyone. Members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Committee -- a top political advisory body -- debated how a U.S. company could understand Chinese culture well enough to make the movie.</p>              <p>""The film's protagonist is China's national treasure and all the elements are Chinese,"" said Wu Jiang, an arts executive, at a Consultative Committee meeting, according to a contemporary account in a state-owned newspaper. ""Why didn't we make such a film?""</p>              <p>China's box office exploded in 2010 with the release of ""Avatar,"" director James Cameron's 3-D epic. Chinese moviegoers waited in line for hours, and scalped tickets sold for as much as $100. ""Avatar"" grossed $204 million in China, more than triple the record at the time.</p>              <p>Two years later, the quota of imported movies permitted into China was raised to 34 from 20 in a deal negotiated between then-Vice President Joe Biden and then-Vice President Xi. The deal all but guaranteed that most big-budget Hollywood features -- except those with content deemed objectionable -- would be shown in China.</p>              <p>""I prefer to watch Hollywood films because the chance of a domestic film being crappy is much bigger than a Hollywood film,"" said Liu Jing, a 25-year-old postgraduate student studying finance policy in Beijing.</p>              <p>Ms. Jing said she became a fan of superhero films from Marvel Studios as a high-school student and now goes to movie theaters at least once a month.</p>              <p>Hollywood executives can rattle off the rules for getting a movie approved by Chinese censors: no sex (too unseemly); no ghosts (too spiritual). Among 10 prohibited plot elements are ""disrupts the social order"" and ""jeopardizes social morality."" Time travel is frowned upon because of its premise that individuals can change history.</p>              <p>U.S. filmmakers sometimes anticipate Chinese censors and alter movies before their release. The Oscar-winning alien-invasion drama ""Arrival"" was edited to make a Chinese general appear less antagonistic before the film's debut in China this year.</p>              <p>The superhero hit ""Logan"" was 14 minutes shorter in China after Chinese censors cut scenes of beheading and impalement.</p>              <p>For ""Passengers,"" the space adventure starring Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, a scene showing Mr. Pratt's bare backside was removed, and a scene of Mr. Pratt chatting in Mandarin with a robot bartender was added.</p>              <p>There remains a gap between China's promise and its profitability. A dollar spent at a U.S. box office typically generates about $2 in revenue in the decade after a movie's release. That compares with about 29 cents in China, which is weak in post-theatrical moneymakers such as DVDs and TV deals.</p>              <p>When Paramount Pictures needed cash this year the studio didn't turn to its parent company, Viacom Inc. Instead, former Paramount Chief Executive Brad Grey talked with nine investors -- five from China -- before agreeing to a $1 billion deal with Shanghai Media Group Corp. and Huahua Media.</p>              <p>When Mr. Grey was fired weeks later, his Chinese partners hit pause on the deal, triggering worry among investors counting on the overseas funds to prop up the ailing studio. Paramount hasn't said if the deal has closed.</p>              <p>Yet Comcast Corp.'s Universal Pictures and Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. have sold a stake in their films to Chinese firms. New movie companies have risen with help from Chinese investors, some headed by former executives of Warner Bros. and Walt Disney Co.</p>              <p>No company has been more aggressive in pursuing Hollywood partnerships than Wanda, a conglomerate run by Wang Jianlin, China's richest man, that made its name building shopping malls across China in the 1990s.</p>              <p>In 2012, Wanda bought AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., a Leawood, Kan., exhibitor that is now the largest movie-theater operator in the world. The company's other entertainment holdings include Legendary Entertainment, the production company behind ""Kong: Skull Island."" It recently built Wanda Studios in the coastal city of Qingdao, which houses 50 soundstages, the largest stretching to more than 100,000 square feet.</p>              <p>The company hit a roadblock earlier this year when its $1 billion bid to acquire Dick Clark Productions was called off. Mr. Wang has long said he wants to own a major Hollywood studio.</p>              <p>Some deals have allowed Chinese executives to vertically integrate their companies in a fashion that has been illegal in the U.S. since the 1940s. Wanda, for instance, owns a production company that develops movies, the sound stages where they are filmed and the theaters where they are shown.</p>              <p>Chinese officials schedule the release of U.S. imports during less popular weekends so they don't cannibalize Chinese movie grosses, keeping Hollywood's annual share of the Chinese box office at around 40%.</p>              <p>The deal setting the quota of U.S. movies is up for review this year, worrying Hollywood executives that disagreements over trade between the two countries could spill over into the movie business and hamper negotiations.</p>              <p>But across China, theater construction continues with screens that will need U.S. and Chinese movies. Cineappo, a joint venture co-owned by the state-run China Film Group, is at work turning karaoke bars into movie theaters to attract young Chinese couples out on dates, said Yi Li, a board director at the company.</p>              <p>""The old generation used to go to karaoke,"" he said.

"152","2017-05-28","Don't worry, Hollywood. China's not a threat; The country's film industry is not successful artistically or financially.","1902818762","Los Angeles Times","A.24","> China about to take over Hollywood? Chinese investment has flooded into the industry in recent years. AMC, the world's largest network of theaters, is owned by the Dalian Wanda Group, which also has purchased Legendary Picture Productions. Three other entertainment giants -- Dick Clark Productions, Voltage Pictures and MGM -- also would have been snapped up by Chinese companies this year if those deals hadn't fallen prey to Beijing's crackdown on capital flight.</p>
<p>The pace of dealmaking has been so furious that Congress may get involved. Late last year, 16 members of Congress signed a letter warning of the ramifications of a Chinese assault on Hollywood. ""Beijing could dictate what is and isn't made,"" then-Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.) warned in an op-ed in the Washington Post.</p>
<p>As someone who has moved between China and America since 1980, I share those concerns. It's been 20 years since Hollywood made a movie in which Chinese authorities or China itself were painted in a somewhat negative light. Most recently, China saved an American in ""The Martian,"" saved the planet in ""Arrival"" and in ""Transformers: Age of Extinction,"" Paramount portrayed Chinese officials as more competent than their American counterparts. Hollywood's craven currying of Chinese favor in exchange for a piece of its vast market rivals only that of Mark Zuckerberg's ploys to get Facebook unblocked in China.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That said, before we unspool into a tizzy of anti-Chinese paranoia, it's important to remember two things: China's film industry remains abysmal artistically, and it has begun to flail financially. Indeed, while some American observers worry about China's takeover of the U.S. entertainment industry, their Chinese counterparts, with some justification, fret that it could end up the other way around.</p>
<p>First, the numbers. In 2016, China's much-vaunted filmmaking industry churned out 1,000 movies, clearly a case of quantity over quality. On average, these movies made about $2 million apiece in China compared with the $70 million the average Western movie made there. In fact, Hollywood accounted for 42% of China's box office take last year even though, under World Trade Organization rules, Western films were capped at 34 releases in China. That number is set to go up in 2017, so things could get even worse for China's homemade films.</p>
<p>What's more, almost every Chinese film company is facing financial difficulties. Huayi Brothers, a Chinese knockoff of Warner Bros., which once claimed that its market valuation would exceed $17 billion, is now worth barely north of $3 billion, down from $15 billion. The stock price of Enlight, another studio, has fallen 60% since the go-go days of 2015.</p>
<p>China's box office revenue is stagnant too. After climbing 50% in 2015, it slowed to a crawl in 2016 and this year, it's actually down. The only bright spots have been two films -- ""Furious 8"" and the Hong Kong comedy ""The Mermaid,"" which weren't made in mainland China.</p>
<p>There's lots of debate about the reasons for this downturn, but a central one is the simple fact of Chinese censorship: Chinese films will continue to stink as long as the government keeps its hands in the business of making movies.</p>
<p>Take a look at the most ambitious Western-Chinese project ever made: ""The Great Wall"" starring Matt Damon. The storyline was profoundly conservative, casting Damon and others as defenders of the Chinese state against a gang of monsters. The only redeeming feature this lemon had was special effects.</p>
<p>And not only was the movie a product of state censors but so were the reviews. When audiences gave the movie lukewarm ratings -- 4.9 out of 10 -- on Chinese online movie sites similar to Rotten Tomatoes, the People's Daily reprimanded those sites in an editorial, resulting in at least one of them removing the reviews. ""The Great Wall"" is reportedly set to lose Universal, the China Film Group and other partners $75 million.</p>
<p>In an online essay, one Chinese ad executive listed the reasons blockbusters couldn't be made in China. Something like ""The Hunger Games"" would never work, he noted, because ""it was about a bunch of poor people opposing a dictatorship."" Scratch ""Ironman"" too because the People's Liberation Army would demand a say in the depiction of new military technology. ""Gravity"" would be a nonstarter because it concerns a crash in space and China's space agency wouldn't allow anything like that. ""Fast and Furious"" would need input from China's traffic cops. And as for ""The Lord of the Rings,"" no way. In 2009, the China State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television -- China's movie czar -- announced that fantasy films were ""rampant"" and ordered producers to base future scripts on domestic fairy tales only.</p>
<p>Is there an issue with Hollywood bending over backward to please the Red Mandarins in Beijing? Definitely. But it's important not to exaggerate the threat. Before China can stage-manage Hollywood into telling China's story, it's got to have a decent story to tell in the first place.</p>

"153","2017-06-23","Time to Say Bye for Now to China's Largest Deal Makers","1912449382","Wall Street Journal","B.12","> Analysis and Commentary]</p>
<p>China's top deal makers are at the epicenter of a shake-up. The seismic waves will ripple afar.</p>
<p>China's banking regulator has asked the country's lenders to investigate loans extended to a group of companies that have aggressively invested overseas, according to The Wall Street Journal. The firms in question include Anbang Insurance Group, HNA Group, Fosun International and Wanda Group, which together have spent tens of billions of dollars in recent years to snap up assets around the globe.</p>
<p>Companies directly related already have felt the pain. A cinema unit of Wanda, which also owns AMC Entertainment, fell 10% Thursday. Shares of Hong Kong-listed Fosun International were down 6%.</p>
<p>The news came a week after the chairman of Anbang was detained by a special investigative unit looking at economic crimes. Anbang has risen from obscurity to become an insurer with assets approaching $300 billion, including New York's Waldorf Astoria hotel. It has grown so big partly by issuing short-dated high-yielding financial products to raise money.</p>
<p>All of these companies have loaded up debt, sometimes using obscure financing to fund overseas ambitions. Beijing is legitimately worried about their increasing risks and intricate web with the banks. A clampdown could send shock waves through China's financial system.</p>
<p>The impact would be felt outside China, too. Deals that are yet to be completed now have an added level of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Singapore logistics firm CWT, pending a $1 billion takeover from HNA, fell 5.3% Thursday to a level not seen since the deal announcement. HNA is still in the process of buying a 25% stake in Old Mutual's U.S. asset-management unit and a majority stake in Trump-backer Anthony Scaramucci's hedge fund, Skybridge.</p>
<p>Another worry is if these companies need to sell some of their assets if Beijing really turns the taps off. HNA is Deutsche Bank's largest shareholder with a nearly 10% stake. It also owns around one-quarter of Hilton Worldwide Holdings. Both deals were accomplished with highly engineered financial structures, the kind that may make regulators antsy.</p>
<p>More broadly, the ""China bid,"" which has kept global deal-making humming, will take an even longer breather than previously thought. Companies in the U.S. and Europe looking to sell themselves may now have a harder time finding a good price if these acquisitive companies are withdrawing themselves from their buying spree. China's financial plumbing problems could flush assets down the drain.</p>

It was time, he said, for Hollywood to acknowledge Chinese tastes and preferences.</p><p>Today, it's a different picture. Legendary is trying to recover from a series of box-office misfires, and the Dick Clark deal fizzled under heightened scrutiny from Chinese authorities and concern over the price tag. With China's banking regulator last month starting investigations into borrowing for overseas investment by Wanda and other companies, the narrative of Wang as a Hollywood conqueror is looking more like a tale of hubris meeting harsh realities.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, it's a humbling moment for the 62-year-old former army officer who said he wanted to buy one of the six major studios, a grand pronouncement for a country with few celebrity businessmen.</p><p>""Wang's boldness worked wonderfully because it brought deal flow and visibility to his company,"" said Marc Ganis, co-founder and president of Jiaflix Enterprises, which helps studios distribute movies in China. ""But there is something to be said for modesty in China. When the celebrity CEO culture is applied in a culture that values modesty, there's going to be friction.""</p><p>The Chinese government's scrutiny of its richest companies -- part of a broader effort to stem perceived risks to its financial system -- comes amid the country's slowest economic growth in years. At the forefront of the concern is debt. In May, Moody's downgraded China's sovereign credit rating for the first time since 1989.</p><p>The clampdown could have far-reaching consequences for Hollywood, which has been looking to China's wealthy businessmen including Wang to fund its movies and market them in the world's second-largest box-office market.</p><p>Government action has been a problem for Wang, who made no secret about his desire to invest in American films slates and studios. During his visit to Los Angeles to promote his Qingdao studio project, he chastised Hollywood for its reliance on reboots and remakes. ""We have to make Hollywood go back to storytelling,"" he told the crowd.</p><p>Many Hollywood veterans privately grumbled that those statements were reminiscent of past outsiders from countries such as Germany and India who wanted a piece of the action and saw their investments falter. Money and will power aren't the only things in play in Hollywood.</p><p>""Wanda was very public about what they were doing, and that backfired on them,"" said a Hollywood producer who has done work in China but asked to remain anonymous to protect industry relationships.</p><p>Wang made his name as a businessman by turning around a state-owned developer in the city of Dalian, and later transforming it into a moneymaking real estate and entertainment enterprise. Wanda is now known for its Wanda Plazas -- sprawling developments that include shopping, hotels, restaurants and often movie theaters.</p><p>Wanda began its Hollywood buying binge in 2012, with the purchase of AMC Theatres for $2.6 billion. Wanda then successfully used AMC to roll up other circuits including U.S. rival Carmike Cinemas and major European chains, making it the world's biggest theater owner. AMC's stock surged as a result.</p><p>But its entries into the content side of the business haven't gone as smoothly. Legendary has suffered recent disappointments including ""Warcraft"" and ""The Great Wall,"" a $150-million co-production that failed to become a global hit.</p><p>""His brand has taken a hit,"" Stanley Rosen, a political scientist at USC and a China film expert, said of Wang. ""He's had problems in both China and the U.S.""</p><p>The misses triggered management shake-ups. The company is still trying to find a new chief executive after founder Thomas Tull exited in January. Wanda was in advanced talks to bring aboard former Fox film boss Jim Gianopulos to turn Legendary into a full-fledged studio, but he went to lead Paramount Pictures instead.</p><p>Jack Gao, Legendary's interim CEO, told Hollywood trade magazine Variety in May that Wanda has committed $1 billion in financing to Legendary to turn it into a major media giant. Legendary production head Mary Parent, a well-respected executive and producer, is leading an ambitious slate that includes the sequels to ""Pacific Rim"" and ""Godzilla.""</p><p>""Wanda is fully committed to its strategy to invest in and build current and new entertainment assets in international regions including the U.S.,"" Gao said in a statement.</p><p>Nonetheless, Wanda had to reconsider its aggressive approach to Hollywood after two of its biggest potential deals fell through. Wanda was close to an agreement to buy 49% of Viacom Inc.-owned Paramount Pictures last year, but that plan was scuttled by Viacom's controlling shareholders.</p><p>Then, in November, Wanda said it would pay $1 billion for Dick Clark Productions, which would have been its first purchase of an American TV production company. That deal collapsed in March after the Chinese government and Wanda balked at the asking price.</p><p>The buying spree also sparked a backlash in the United States. U.S. lawmakers raised concerns about Wanda's moves in Hollywood, citing misgivings about the potential influence the communist country could wield over American film and TV content. Wang has long had close ties with the Communist Party elite -- a New York Times investigation in 2015 said relatives of several top officials own stakes in his company.</p><p>With capital tightening up and no other logical takeover candidates for sale, Wanda has to focus on building its entertainment strategy through Legendary and AMC.</p><p>""Money got them into the position of power they're in now. Now it's all about execution,"" said Los Angeles-based producer and former studio executive Randy Greenberg. ""How do they get all those companies to work together? That's what Wanda has to figure out.""</p><p>In a rare interview with the Financial Times, Wang recently said he would refocus the company on domestic investment.</p><p>""The development of domestic business is certainly our main focus,"" he told the paper, ""because China's entertainment market, tourism market, sports market have just begun. These [domestic] areas must be the focus of our investment.""</p><p>For example, the company just opened its new Harbin Wanda City, a sprawling cultural tourism project in Northeast China with an outdoor theme park and the world's largest indoor ski resort.</p><p>Local projects also include Wanda's ""movie metropolis"" in the coastal city of Qingdao that is set to fully open next year, representing a major test for the company. The project is intended to draw production companies and studios with its 30 soundstages and a rebate program to cover 40% of production costs.</p><p>Few U.S. producers have signed on, though Wanda's Legendary filmed part of the new ""Pacific Rim"" movie in Qingdao.</p><p>""It hasn't been shown yet that Qingdao will be successful attracting a lot of Hollywood,"" USC's Rosen said.</p><p>Analysts said foreign investment might pick up if restrictions are eased after 19th Party Congress, a major political conclave scheduled for fall.

An article in The New York Times on Wednesday detailed how HNA, with little disclosure to investors in its listed companies or overseas bonds, has regularly given business to relatives and associates of the company's senior executives.</p><p>The bank's email listed concerns about HNA, including its shareholding and corporate structure, Chinese regulatory interest in the company and its complex business model. It also cited allegations of political connections. As a result, the bank decided to remove itself from any transactions, a senior executive wrote.</p><p>""We simply don't know what we don't know, and are not prepared to take the risk,"" Matthew M. Koder, Bank of America's president for Asia Pacific, wrote in the email, dated June 28.</p><p>""Given the importance of maintaining rigorous client selection standards, we have decided not to be involved with transactions with the HNA Group at this point in time,"" Mr. Koder added.</p><p>Bank of America declined to comment.</p><p>HNA declined to comment.</p><p>HNA is a privately held company that has received much of its funding from Chinese state banks, which have given HNA a $60 billion line of credit, according to corporate filings.</p><p>Bank of America had been in discussions with HNA to enter new lending partnerships in future transactions, according to a person with direct knowledge but who was not authorized to speak publicly because the discussions were private. It has also been among several other banks helping HNA to take at least one of its myriad private companies public.</p><p>The cold shoulder from one of the biggest banks in the United States is the latest in a series of road bumps for HNA, an aggressive conglomerate whose holdings include an airline, Hilton Hotels and a technology wholesaler.</p><p>The bank's decision came days after reports that a Chinese banking regulator had asked domestic banks to examine their exposure to some of China's biggest overseas acquirers, including HNA Group. Speaking at a briefing in Beijing on June 22, Liu Zhiqing, a senior banking official at the China Banking Regulatory Commission, warned that these companies could pose a ""systemic risk"" to the country's banks.</p><p>Anbang Insurance Group was the first big Chinese company to make a splash overseas when it bought the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan three years ago, drawing attention to Chinese companies with global ambitions and huge war chests. And Dalian Wanda quickly became a heavyweight in Hollywood -- spending more than $8 billion on entertainment companies like AMC Theaters and Legendary Entertainment.</p><p>This year, however, those companies appeared to hit the brakes on their drive to acquire Western companies.</p><p>HNA's deal-making machine, on the other hand, has seemed relentless.</p><p>In recent years, HNA has acquired the California technology companies Ingram Micro and Swissport and bought large stakes in Hilton Hotels and Deutsche Bank. Its 9.99 percent stake in Deutsche Bank has now drawn scrutiny from the European Central Bank, which is said to be looking at whether HNA meets the criteria for large bank shareholders.</p><p>Questions about its ownership structure have long dogged HNA.</p><p>The Chinese billionaire and social media celebrity Guo Wengui has leveled public accusations that HNA is controlled by one of the most powerful families in China and by the relatives of people running the country's anti-corruption campaign. Mr. Guo has posted data on Twitter about HNA's corporate structures and even the passport numbers of some of those relatives.</p><p>HNA has denied those ties, saying that Mr. Guo's allegations are ""completely unfounded and false.""</p><p>Nevertheless, one of Bank of America's concerns highlighted ""too many irregularities in the historical and current shareholding and corporate structure,"" as well as the ""opaque nature of some of the existing shareholders"" among its concerns.</p><p>HNA has said that it relied on American and European banks to help fuel its acquisitions, borrowing billions of dollars for its transactions. Those banks, as well as lawyers and auditors, have examined HNA.</p><p>Yet, questions persist as to whether the banks have the proper due diligence and risk control processes for dealing with Chinese companies.</p><p>For most of the big banks, doing business with HNA has been lucrative. On one side of business, banks have helped HNA buy companies by arranging what is called collateralized financing. That has entailed allowing HNA to borrow money against the shares of the company that it is acquiring.</p><p>Big banks have also received large paydays for advising on HNA's acquisitions. HNA and its affiliates overseas have paid an estimated $100 million in fees to banks advising on mergers and acquisitions since 2016, according to estimates by Dealogic.</p><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""Photograph"" /><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""Y"" /><div class=""Photograph_content""><p>The Bank of America Tower in Manhattan.

"160","2017-07-26","Boutique Studio's Seesawing Fate Reflects Industry's Volatility","1923196572","New York Times","B.1","> ANGELES -- Two summers ago, Legendary Entertainment was the belle of the Hollywood ball.<p>Thomas Tull, who founded Legendary, a boutique studio, in 2000, finding hits like ""Godzilla"" and ""Pacific Rim,"" strutted across a stage at the Comic-Con International fan convention and touted two coming films, ""Warcraft"" and ""The Great Wall,"" as surefire blockbusters. Behind the scenes, Legendary was working to tap into Chinese money flowing to Hollywood. That resulted in Dalian Wanda's purchase of Legendary in January 2016 for what seemed like a large price, $3.5 billion.</p><p>Now, in a reflection of the volatility of the film business and the precariousness of deal making with Chinese companies, Legendary is facing uncomfortable questions about its future.</p><p>Legendary has been bruised at the global box office; ""Warcraft"" and ""The Great Wall"" flopped. The studio has been without a chief executive since Mr. Tull left in January. (He said that was his plan all along; Wanda publicly indicated otherwise.) And Legendary suddenly finds itself operating amid uncertainty -- something that Hollywood loathes -- as Beijing clamps down on Wanda and other conglomerates, scrutinizing balance sheets and reviewing loans from state-owned banks.</p><p>Is Legendary speeding toward the Hollywood graveyard?</p><p>A close look at the company suggests no. In fact, there are concrete signs that Legendary is moving past its recent box office troubles. Even so, the upheaval surrounding Wanda is real and could complicate Legendary's growth plans.</p><p>The studio, which employs about 300 people, has ample money to make movies, including announced sequels to ""Godzilla,"" ""Kong: Skull Island"" and ""Pacific Rim."" Over the last six months, the studio has secured cash investments of nearly $580 million. Legendary also has a $700 million line of credit with JPMorgan Chase that extends through 2021. This information was provided by a Legendary executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss financial matters.</p><p>Melissa Zukerman, a Legendary spokeswoman, confirmed the numbers on Tuesday but declined to comment beyond a statement released last week. It said, in part, ""Legendary is well capitalized with liquidity to fund its film and TV slates and operate its business as usual.""</p><p>Whether Legendary has the ability to pull off its ambitious growth plans is less certain. Its expansion goals include taking more control of its North American film distribution (it relies on Universal Pictures and Warner Bros. to release its movies) and increasing output from a couple of movies a year to six or more.</p><p>With the right support from Wanda, financially and politically, Legendary could also build a film distribution system in China, one that could be rented to other Hollywood studios, which are now required to use a state-owned distribution system.</p><p>In many ways, Legendary finds is in the usual Hollywood spot: crossing its fingers that film bets pay off and a corporate parent comes through with promised backing. In May, Jack Gao, Legendary's acting chief executive, told Variety magazine that Wanda had committed hundreds of millions of dollars in additional funding.</p><p>Legendary has also been caught in the old Hollywood game of perception versus reality. Chinese conglomerates like Wanda, Anbang Insurance Group, HNA Group and Fosun International are being reined in because they have used cheap debt provided by state banks to spend lavishly, in some cases seeming to overpay for acquisitions.</p><p>Just last week, Wanda tore up a $9.3 billion agreement to sell a portfolio of hotels and theme parks to the property firm Sunac China Holdings, instead selling it just the theme parks, a move that lessened Sunac's debt level. (Wanda reached a deal to sell its hotels to another Chinese company, R &amp; F Properties.)</p><p>Because of write downs from movie misfires, spending on fast-tracked film and television projects, and the accelerated vesting of stock options in anticipation of a sale, Legendary lost $343 million in 2014 and $462 million in 2015. The losses were disclosed in filings with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange related to a subsequent effort by Wanda to merge the studio with a publicly traded subsidiary, Wanda Cinema Line, which owns theaters. Wanda abandoned that maneuver, citing changing market conditions.</p><p>Yet Wanda paid $3.5 billion for the little studio.</p><p>In reality, according to the Legendary executive who provided internal information and the spokeswoman who confirmed it, the actual deal was slightly different. The price was $1.88 billion, plus the assumption of Legendary's debt, much but not all of which has since been paid off.</p><p>Those details were not mentioned when Wanda's chairman, Wang Jianlin, barnstormed through Hollywood in October to promote Legendary as a jewel at the center of an expanding entertainment empire. Soon, he said then, Wanda's assets would include the purchase of a small TV company, Dick Clark Productions, for $1 billion, and an $8.2 billion studio and theme park complex being built in Qingdao, a city north of Shanghai. Wanda also owns AMC Entertainment, the No. 1 theater chain in North America.</p><p>But Wanda soon abandoned the Dick Clark deal and ""The Great Wall"" was a debacle, costing at least $250 million to make and market and taking in $332 million worldwide. (Theater owners keep roughly 50 percent of ticket sales.) The misfire led to the departure of Peter Loehr, the chief of Legendary's China operation and a ""Great Wall"" producer.</p><p>Lately, however, Legendary has shown signs of resurgence.</p><p>The studio's last release, ""Kong: Skull Island,"" was a hit, collecting $566 million worldwide in March against a production budget of $185 million. DVD sales were also strong. As a result, Legendary expects to turn a profit for 2017 of roughly $30 million.</p><p>As the hunt for a successor to Mr. Tull progresses, Legendary's highly regarded production chief, Mary Parent, who joined the company last year, (""Kong: Skull Island"" was her first film), has hired lieutenants and started to assemble new films. Legendary executives, agents and producers affiliated with the company say that Ms. Parent's team has put more checks and balances in place to ensure that the company is not overspending on production, as had sometimes happened.</p><p>Legendary's next release, ""Pacific Rim: Uprising,"" which will arrive in February, cost about $150 million to make, for instance. Its 2013 franchise predecessor cost an estimated $190 million.</p><p>Ms. Parent's lineup also includes a sequel to ""Kong: Skull Island"" that will find Godzilla battling the giant ape; ""Skyscraper,"" a disaster thriller starring Dwayne Johnson; ""Detective Pikachu,"" a live-action film based on the Pokemon character; and a reboot of the science-fiction classic ""Dune,"" with Denis Villeneuve in the director's chair.</p><p>Additionally, Ms. Parent, an Oscar nominee for producing ""The Revenant,"" has some smaller films in the works, including an adaptation of the book ""Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus."" A not-so-minor financial footnote: Legendary is also an investor in a sequel to ""Jurassic World,"" which took in $1.7 billion worldwide in 2015.</p><p>Legendary, like every Hollywood upstart, has found itself at a crossroads before. Unlike most, it has always found a way forward.</p><p>Mr. Tull, once a Laundromat owner, attracted Legendary's first investors on a premise that turned out to be faulty -- that strong DVD sales had put a floor under high-end fantasy films. The DVD market started to crumble in 2005, about the time Legendary took root. Mr. Tull pivoted to the foreign box office, which was starting to grow, especially in China.</p><p>With private equity funding, Legendary persuaded Warner Bros. to let it invest in a several films that became megahits, including ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and the ""Hangover"" movies. Legendary's own run as a creative force started in 2007 with the bloody ""300,"" which cost $65 million to make and took in $456 worldwide -- a success that was cited by Wanda last year, among others, as proof of the studio's potential.</p><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""Photograph"" /><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""Y"" /><div class=""Photograph_content""><p>Legendary Entertainment Plans Sequels to ""Kong: Skull Island,"" Above, and ""Pacific Rim.""

"161","2017-07-28","Wanda is selling massive Chinese studio; Media giant's decision is its latest retreat from Hollywood.","1923917167","Los Angeles Times","C.1","> 2013, Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin unveiled plans for a moviemaking metropolis in the coastal city of Qingdao, with state-of-the-art film and TV soundstages and a massive water tank to draw big Hollywood productions.</p>
<p>Celebrities such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Nicole Kidman flew out to witness the unveiling of what was supposed to be the centerpiece of Wang's efforts to make China a film business destination.</p>
<p>Less than four years later, Wang, the chairman of real estate conglomerate-turned-media-giant Dalian Wanda Group, is in retreat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The brash business tycoon is reportedly unloading the studio business, part of his planned $7.3-billion Qingdao Movie Metropolis complex, in one of the most striking setbacks to date in his quest to become a global media mogul.</p>
<p>The move, previously reported by Chinese media and then detailed Thursday by the Wall Street Journal, is part of a broader sale of Wanda Group's assets aimed at reducing debt. Wanda said this month it would sell $9.3 billion in tourism projects and hotels to real estate rival Sunac China. Under terms of the deal with Sunac, Wanda will retain a 9% stake in the studio.</p>
<p>""Clearly this indicates Wang is lowering his expectations and goals for the entertainment business,"" said John Burke, head of the entertainment group at law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld. ""People were looking at Wanda like they were the real deal. There's a lot of tire kickers over here from China, but Wang clearly seemed to be a guy who could write checks and do the deal. Now people are scratching their heads.""</p>
<p>A Wanda spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. However, in a recent interview with Chinese news service Caixin, Wang said the sale of assets to Sunac and another real estate company, R&F Properties, was in response to the Chinese government's call to reduce leverage.</p>
<p>""Wanda sold what should be sold and maintained what should be saved,"" Wang said. ""The tourism assets that were sold always have slow investment return and greater capital pressure.""</p>
<p>Wanda's sudden retreat comes as China's communist leaders have moved to rein in some of the country's biggest private companies. Beijing believes Wanda and other firms have borrowed too much and invested blindly overseas -- overpaying for assets that have little strategic value to China.</p>
<p>A surge in lending since the 2008 financial crisis has put the already slowing Chinese economy on uneven ground. Outstanding debt grew to about 260% of GDP at the end of last year, up from 160% in 2008, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.</p>
<p>Political scientists say closer scrutiny of Wanda's finances is warranted, but they also suspect Wang and other tycoons are being chastened for their bravado. President Xi Jinping is China's first strongman leader in decades and he's been consolidating his power in the lead-up to the 19th party congress later this year.</p>
<p>The Qingdao studio project, in particular, appeared to be struggling despite the fanfare with which it was announced. Wang came to Los Angeles last year offering a 40% subsidy to lure Hollywood films to Qingdao. Plans for Wanda Studios, scheduled to fully open next year, featured 30 soundstages, including the world's largest at 2.5 acres, and a heated underwater stage.</p>
<p>But among the U.S. studios there were few, if any, takers for the Qingdao project. The lone American studio to film at the Qingdao facilities was Legendary Entertainment, which Wanda owns. Wanda has also struggled to attract many local productions, and construction is not yet complete, according to people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to comment.</p>
<p>The project is said to have been hobbled by leadership turnover and ambitions that exceeded the company's grasp. Plans to create an annual film festival at the site, for example, never got off the ground.</p>
<p>For months, there have been signs that Wanda would have to scale back its Hollywood takeover in the face of government scrutiny and scrapped deals.</p>
<p>It's a stark contrast from the last couple years when Wang boldly declared he wanted to pour billions into the studio system and even buy one of the majors, such as Paramount Pictures. He also pledged to beat Walt Disney Co.'s theme park business in China, a promise that proved faulty.</p>
<p>Wanda began its Hollywood buying binge in 2012, with the purchase of AMC Theatres for $2.6 billion, which then rolled up other circuits, including U.S. rival Carmike Cinemas and major European chains.</p>
<p>But other efforts, especially on the content side of the business, haven't been so easy. Wanda this year had to scrap a $1-billion purchase of Dick Clark Productions, which produces the Golden Globe Awards. Previously, Viacom Inc.'s controlling shareholders scuttled a plan to sell 49% of Paramount Pictures to Wanda.</p>
<p>Wanda last year said it paid an eye-popping $3.5 billion for Legendary Pictures, though Legendary executives now say the real figure was about $1.9 billion plus the assumption of debt. Legendary has produced a string of flops, including ""The Great Wall,"" the biggest-ever Chinese co-production, and ""Warcraft."" (The Warner Bros. film ""Kong: Skull Island,"" however, turned a profit.)</p>
<p>Legendary still has not replaced Chief Executive Thomas Tull, who left in January. Wanda Cultural Industry leader Jack Gao has been serving as interim CEO, raising questions about the leadership of the storied film producer involved in such movies as ""The Dark Knight.""</p>
<p>Wanda had wanted to merge Legendary into its publicly traded film business, but market conditions combined with Legendary's financial losses made that impossible. Still, Legendary maintains it is well capitalized and is confident in its upcoming movies.</p>
<p>""Legendary is well capitalized with liquidity to fund its film and TV slates and operate its business as usual,"" the company said recently, after reports said the government was starting to take a hard line on deal-making by Wanda.</p>
<p>Publicly traded AMC Theatres sought to calm investors' nerves this month, saying its acquisitions were not funded by Wanda. AMC made the comments after its stock fell 10% in one day on Wall Street. AMC recently bought Carmike Cinemas, Britain's Odeon & UCI Cinemas, and Nordic Cinema Group in Stockholm.</p>

AMC Entertainment, part of China's Dalian Wanda Group, last year bought Odeon &amp; UCI Cinemas Group in Europe, and ran or had interests in more than 11,000 screens in 1,006 theaters as of Sept. 30, according to regulatory filings.</p>
<p>Cineworld was responding to a statement from Regal in which the Knoxville, Tenn.-based company disclosed the talks and a takeover offer of $23 a share. The offer, which Cineworld confirmed, represents a 26% premium to Regal's closing price on Monday.</p>
<p>Regal's shares rose 8% on Tuesday after Reuters first reported the talks, and they climbed further in after-hours trading when Regal issued its statement.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the stock climbed 2.8% to $20.17 in New York, while Cineworld shares fell nearly 20% to GBP 5.57 ($7.47) in London.</p>
<p>Cineworld on Wednesday cautioned that there is no guarantee a deal will be struck but if it proceeds it would be funded by a mixture of debt and a rights issue. The company added that the acquisition would be classified as a reverse takeover under London Stock Exchange rules.</p>
<p>Regal, which has 7,315 screens in 561 theaters, is controlled by Phil Anschutz's Anschutz Corp. through its ownership of Regal Class B shares. Mr. Anschutz, whose fortune Forbes estimates at more than $12 billion, was part of a consortium that took control of the then Regal Cinemas Inc. in 2001 after the chain entered chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p>Regal said on Tuesday that it wouldn't comment further or respond to questions until a deal was reached or discussions were called off.</p>

"165","2018-01-27","Tencent takes stake in Skydance Media; The Chinese social media giant purchases 5% to 10% of the L.A. production company.","1991563851","Los Angeles Times","C.3","> social media giant Tencent Holdings has acquired a minority stake in Los Angeles-based production company Skydance Media, the companies said Thursday, in a move that bucks the recent trend of Chinese companies avoiding Hollywood investments.</p>
<p>Tencent, which owns social apps such as WeChat and QQ, has purchased a stake of 5% to 10% in Skydance for more than $100 million, according to a person familiar with the deal who was not authorized to comment.</p>
<p>The deal gives Skydance, founded by David Ellison (son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison), a powerful partner with massive reach among online consumers in China, the world's second-largest movie market. Along with marketing prowess and capital, the investment gives Skydance access to Tencent's expertise in the gaming industry, the companies said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As part of the pact, Tencent will be able to invest in Skydance films, the companies said. Skydance, launched in 2010, is best known for blockbusters including the recent ""Mission: Impossible"" and ""Star Trek"" movies. The company is also investing heavily in television production, gaming and virtual reality.</p>
<p>""We believe this partnership will support Skydance's expansion internationally, across media and into television production, and provide Tencent with attractive content that we can share with China consumers,"" said James Mitchell, chief strategy officer for Tencent, in a statement.</p>
<p>China's box-office sales rose to $8.47 billion last year, up 13% from 2016, according to film industry consulting firm Artisan Gateway. China's ticket sales grew only 4% in 2016, marking a substantial slowdown from previous years.</p>
<p>Chinese investment in Hollywood came to a virtual standstill last year as the government there cracked down on what it saw as irrational investments in foreign industries, including entertainment, by companies such as Dalian Wanda Group.</p>
<p>But Tencent has managed to remain unscathed by the clampdown, maintaining a lower profile than many rivals. The company backed Burbank-based start-up studio STX Entertainment in 2016 and has invested in films such as ""Wonder Woman."" In November, Tencent acquired a 12% stake in Snapchat owner Snap Inc. for $2 billion.</p>
<p>Tencent also backed Original Force animation, a Chinese animation company that tried to expand in the U.S. with feature films. Sandra Rabins and Penney Finkelman Cox, the executives hired to lead the charge, left the company in August.</p>

"166","2018-02-17","Transparency fears foiled Chinese bid for U.S. stock exchange","2002591913","The Washington Post","A.10",">
		<p>SEC didn't know enough about those who wanted to buy Chicago institution</p>
	<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday said lack of transparency was the reason it thwarted a controversial bid by a group of Chinese investors to purchase the 135-year-old Chicago Stock Exchange.</p>
	<p>The decision comes during a period of heightened concern over China's rise as a commercial power in the East and worries over its access to American intellectual property and U.S. citizens' personal data.</p>
	<p>FBI Director Christopher A. Wray gave voice to the fears during a Senate Intelligence Committee meeting on Feb. 13 when he said China was bent on surpassing the United States in superpower status and said Chinese spies were embedded in American academia.</p>
	<p>The proposed Chicago Stock Exchange deal drew opposition from both sides of the political aisle, with foes saying it compromised U.S. financial markets.</p>
	<p>""We saw this as a bad deal,"" Rep. Robert Pittenger (R-N.C.) said Friday. ""It had to be stopped. We felt that our economic security and trust in the marketplace were threatened.""</p>
	<p>The SEC said in its 75-page decision that it did not know enough about the investors and was not confident it could properly monitor the privately owned exchange after the takeover.</p>
	<p>""The inability of the Chicago Stock Exchange to obtain documents and information necessary for it and the [SEC] to resolve key questions regarding the funding of, and relationship between, upstream investors creates significant doubts about the Exchange's ability to engage in this extensive monitoring,"" the SEC said.</p>
	<p>""Determining the ultimate owners is the key,"" Pittenger said. ""That was the problem.""</p>
	<p>Some observers said that concern over national security did not fuel the SEC's decision.</p>
	<p>""This comes in context of the U.S. being worried about China as a rising national security threat,"" said Derek Scissors, a China economist with the American Enterprise Institute. ""Everyone will think this is part of that reaction. But it's actually about transparency and inexperienced Chinese financial firms. This transaction is minor, and the Chicago Stock Exchange is small. This is not important.""</p>
	<p>The Obama administration did not stand in the way of the proposed $20 million purchase of the Chicago Stock Exchange by a group of Chinese investors led by Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group.</p>
	<p>The would-be buyer said it had no ties to the Chinese government. Supporters said it would spur Chinese business in U.S. markets.</p>
	<p>President Trump publicly opposed the takeover during his campaign.</p>
	<p>""They are taking our jobs. They are taking our wealth. They are taking our base,"" Trump said during one speech.</p>
	<p>Chongqing Casin could not be reached for comment. A spokesman for the Chicago Stock Exchange also could not be reached for comment.</p>
	<p>The Chicago Stock Exchange announced the agreement to be acquired by Chongqing Casin in February 2016. Chongqin Casin invests in real estate and finance.</p>
	<p>SEC staffers had approved the sale of the privately owned exchange last August, but SEC commissioners, led by Chairman Jay Clayton, overrode the staff recommendation and put the deal on hold. The proposed takeover had cleared the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a panel that scrutinizes foreign investment for national security concerns.</p>
	<p>The Chicago Stock Exchange was one of dozens of regional exchanges that started in the 1880s to help local companies sell their stock. It is one of the oldest still open.</p>
	<p>But stock trading began to modernize and centralize toward the end of the 20th century, and the Chicago institution found itself marginalized. It now has less than 1 percent of the trading volume in the United States</p>
	<p>""They are not a big player, they continue to not be a big player,"" said Spencer Mindlin, an analyst who focuses on capital markets at the research and consulting firm Aite Group. ""It's an extremely competitive marketplace where size and scale really matter. They don't have either.""</p>
	<p>The Chicago Stock Exchange deal would have been a first for Chinese ownership of a U.S. exchange, but not the first time for a foreign company. Deutsche Börse bought the U.S.-based International Securities Exchange in 2007. Nasdaq then bought the exchange from Deutsche Börse in 2016.</p>
	<p>Worries over Chinese ownership of U.S. properties is nothing new. The Chinese oil company CNOOC in 2005 withdrew its bid for California-based energy firm Unocal Corp. The decision came after U.S. politicians opposed the deal on national security grounds. Unocal was bought for $18.3 billion by California-based Chevron.</p>
	<p>Last month, the U.S. government blocked the proposed $1.2 billion acquisition of the global payment services company MoneyGram by Ant Financial, an affiliate of the Chinese Alibaba Group.</p>

"167","2018-02-17","Hollywood Helps Raise Curtain for China","2002603708","Wall Street Journal","B.1","> weekend, when many U.S. moviegoers are packing auditoriums for Walt Disney Co.'s ""Black Panther,"" a few dozen theaters will open features with titles like ""Monster Hunt 2"" and ""The Monkey King 3.""</p>
<p>Those sequels are two in a quartet of major Chinese features opening in the U.S. for Lunar New Year, the holiday season that marks China's prime movie-going season and an increasingly popular window for Chinese producers to test their movies' appeal overseas.</p>
<p>Hollywood studios such as Lions Gate Entertainment and Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros. have signed distribution agreements with makers of the four Chinese movies. While the movies aren't expected to make much money in the U.S., their presence on U.S. movie marquees signals China's ambitions to become a global movie-making force.</p>
<p>Within the next five years, China is projected to become the world's No. 1 box-office market. Hollywood studios already see it as an essential source of ticket sales and financing, but to do business inside the country takes years of relationship-building with Chinese firms.</p>
<p>For the U.S. movie industry, distribution of Chinese movies in the U.S. has emerged as the latest way to deepen ties with China's powerful firms and producers.</p>
<p>In addition to the fantasies ""Monster Hunt 2"" and ""The Monkey King 3,"" other Chinese movies coming to U.S. theaters in February include ""Detective Chinatown 2"" from Dalian Wanda Group Co. and ""Operation Red Sea,"" a military action movie developed by China's Ministry of Public Security.</p>
<p>Those four are expected to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in ticket sales in China, but their U.S. distributors aren't expecting windfalls: Three of the movies will show in fewer than 100 U.S. theaters, and together all four might struggle to crack the $2 million mark in state-side grosses, according to their distributors.</p>
<p>""When a Chinese film cracks $1 million is when you start taking out the champagne,"" said Dylan Marchetti, senior vice president of acquisitions and theatrical distribution at Well Go USA, the Plano, Texas-based distributor of ""Monkey King 3"" and ""Operation Red Sea.""</p>
<p>Even in their first day of release, the movies were on track to be megahits in China. ""Monster Hunt 2"" collected $97 million on its first day, a record in the market. ""Detective Chinatown 2"" grossed $59.4 million, while ""Monkey King 3"" raked in $57 million and ""Operation Red Sea"" collected $21 million.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years ago, art-house features from China, like ""Farewell, My Concubine,"" were met with critical raves but puny grosses in the U.S. The 2000 co-production ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" hit it big with $128 million at the box office, and Jet Li action features like ""Hero"" in 2004 and ""Fearless"" in 2006 did respectably.</p>
<p>The last Chinese movie to make a considerable impact in the U.S. was ""Lust, Caution,"" which collected $4.6 million in 2007. Since then, China has grown more intertwined with Hollywood, backing studio lineups and often teaming up with U.S. companies to co-produce movies as it expands its homegrown industry.</p>
<p>The typical U.S. footprint of a Chinese release has grown alongside China's film ambitions to 50 or 60 theaters in recent years, up from about 20, Mr. Marchetti said.</p>
<p>The number of Chinese movies coming to the U.S. has grown, too. Through the 1990s and early 2000s, a handful of Chinese releases were imported to the U.S. every few years. Around 2011, as China's film goals came into focus, the numbers grew substantially, with more than half a dozen coming to U.S. screens in most years. But even previous installments in the ""Monster Hunt"" and ""Monkey King"" franchises, while massive hits in China, have drawn tiny crowds in the U.S.</p>
<p>So far, at least six Chinese titles are scheduled to play in the U.S. this year.</p>
<p>The Chinese studios pay a distribution fee to U.S. companies, which share in profits after a film hits a certain gross-revenue threshold. Most of the Chinese movies will be shown in communities with Chinese-American communities, such as Flushing in New York City and the San Gabriel Valley, near Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Bigger studios are signing the deals as part of a longer game of cultivating ties in the country, said Wendy Reeds, Lions Gate's executive vice president of international sales. ""The way we've built our business in China is through relationships,"" she said.</p>

"168","2018-02-26","Property Purchases Pinch Beijing --- Regulators that seized Anbang inherited U.S. real estate that likely has fallen in value","2007918660","Wall Street Journal","B.9","> Chinese regulators seized control of Anbang Insurance Group Co., they took ownership of more than a dozen luxury U.S. hotels, including New York's famed Waldorf Astoria.</p>
<p>Now, as the Chinese government weighs selling many of these properties, the buildings likely are worth less than what Anbang paid only a couple of years ago, the latest instance of foreign investors rushing into U.S. property only to find the market softening beneath them.</p>
<p>China's insurance regulatory agency said Friday it was assuming control of Anbang to avoid a collapse of the firm after suspected illegal activity by its chairman. In private conversations with hotel brokers and investors, regulators and Anbang have indicated they intend to hold on to the Waldorf, continuing with the insurer's plan to convert more than 1,000 of the hotel's 1,400 guest rooms into condominiums, according to people briefed on the matter.</p>
<p>But Chinese authorities already have started listening to offers for other luxury hotels that Anbang acquired, say people close to the matter. Its portfolio includes the Essex House Hotel overlooking Manhattan's Central Park; Four Seasons Hotels in Austin, Texas., and Jackson Hole, Wyo.; and InterContinental Hotels in Chicago and Miami.</p>
<p>An Anbang spokesman said: ""We remain fully committed to our overseas subsidiaries, businesses, and investments, including those in the United States.""</p>
<p>Hotel revenue in the U.S. is still growing, although the rate of growth has slowed considerably since peaking a few years ago, according to data tracker STR Inc. Revenue per available room, a metric that measures room rates and occupancy levels, grew by 8.2% in 2014. Growth has slowed each year since to 3% in 2017. STR projects growth of 2.7% in 2018.</p>
<p>""Expectations of revenue and profit growth have certainly dampened in the last two years,"" said Sean Hennessey, chief executive of Lodging Advisors, a New York hospitality consulting firm. ""That creates a noticeable decrease in pricing if you're trying to sell a hotel today.""</p>
<p>The U.S. property market has long been a favored destination for overseas investors, thanks to a broad mix of office buildings, hotels and retail properties. The market also offers better title rights than faster-growing emerging markets and better growth prospects than in Europe.</p>
<p>Foreign investment in U.S. hotels and other real estate has been controversial over the years, especially when it involved high-profile properties. Japanese investors caused a stir in the 1980s when they bought trophy assets in the U.S., including Rockefeller Center in Midtown Manhattan and the Pebble Beach golf resort in California. When the property market collapsed, most Japanese investors sold and suffered huge losses.</p>
<p>Chinese buyers have drawn less scrutiny until a few years ago, when their purchases of U.S. properties started to accelerate. Anbang was at the center of a wave of Chinese insurers and other investors that acquired U.S. real estate and in particular high-end hotels, taking advantage of new rules that allowed them to invest abroad more easily.</p>
<p>Many Chinese buyers view luxury hotels in major cities as long-term investments that can provide steady income during a period of low interest rates, real-estate brokers and hotel analysts said. Some said a number of Chinese buyers believe that owning world-famous properties and luxury brands confers prestige on their owners -- one reason Chinese investors frequently outbid other buyers.</p>
<p>In 2015, Anbang acquired the Waldorf for $1.95 billion, the highest price ever paid for a U.S. hotel. That same year, China's Sunshine Insurance Group Co. also purchased New York's Baccarat Hotel for about $230 million, or roughly $2 million a room. This made it one of the most highly valued hotels ever by that popular industry metric. The Baccarat hadn't even checked in a single guest when Sunshine agreed to buy it.</p>
<p>Shanghai prosecutors on Friday said they had indicted Wu Xiaohui, Anbang's ex-chairman, for alleged fraudulent fundraising and abuse of power.</p>
<p>As chairman, he once told an audience at Harvard University that he planned to convert Waldorf guest rooms to condos, hinting that there would be an element of exclusivity.</p>
<p>""A potential buyer needs more than money to qualify for our apartments,"" he boasted to the crowd.</p>
<p>Anbang in 2016 bought a portfolio of luxury hotels from Blackstone Group LP. The New York investment firm had bought those hotels less than a year earlier, turning a profit of about $500 million on the fast sale to Anbang, say people familiar with the situation.</p>
<p>In 2016, at the peak of this buying spree, Chinese companies purchased more than $9 billion of U.S. hotels, up from only about $216 million in 2012, according to real-estate firm JLL. Those sales fell to about $668 million last year after the Chinese government tightened capital controls to prevent companies from moving as much money abroad.</p>
<p>Chinese ownership has caused more unease recently, especially after reports about Anbang's political connections to the Chinese government. President Barack Obama, who had stayed at the Waldorf previously, bypassed it for another hotel during a 2015 visit to New York. While White House officials didn't explain the change, people familiar with the matter cited possible security concerns under Anbang's ownership.</p>

"169","2018-03-02","China's HNA to Sell Stake in Hotel Group","2009473600","Wall Street Journal","B.2","> HNA Group Co. is planning to sell its entire stake in a U.S. company that owns dozens of Hilton hotels and other properties, accelerating plans to dispose of its overseas assets following a Chinese government clampdown on companies' spending abroad.</p>
<p>A securities filing this week from Park Hotel &amp; Resorts Inc., a New York-listed real estate investment trust that owns Hilton resorts, convention centers, airport hotels and other properties across the country, said units of HNA are planning to pursue sales ""of some or all"" of the 25% stake they own in the company.</p>
<p>Since last summer, HNA's borrowing costs have climbed and the company has been struggling to raise cash to meet its near-term debt obligations.</p>
<p>In addition, the Chinese government has raised concerns about what it has called ""irrational"" investing abroad by some of the country's large private conglomerates including HNA, putting pressure on them to sell real estate and other overseas assets.</p>
<p>Anbang Insurance Group Co., another acquisitive Chinese company, was also a big buyer of U.S. hotels and resorts in recent years. Anbang last week was seized by China's insurance regulator and is expected to sell some of assets in the U.S.</p>
<p>The share sales would be done through one or more public stock offerings whose timing would depend on market conditions and other factors, the filing said. HNA's stake in the company is currently worth around $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>HNA, an airlines-to-hotels conglomerate which until recently was one of China's most acquisitive private companies, in the fall of 2016 agreed to buy a 25% stake in Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. from private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP for $6.5 billion.</p>
<p>Hilton Worldwide subsequently split itself up into three publicly listed companies, including Park Hotels and another firm called Hilton Grand Vacations Inc, giving HNA a 25% stake in all three companies.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Park Hotels declined to comment. HNA declined to comment on whether it plans to sell its ownership in the other Hilton entities.</p>
<p>The asset-disposal plans mark a comedown for HNA, which recently went on an aggressive global acquisition spree, buying a large stake in Deutsche Bank AG, office towers in New York and London, and money managers, aircraft lessors and other businesses. Many of the acquisitions, including its purchase of stakes in the Hilton entities, were funded with the help of borrowed money. HNA has around $100 billion in outstanding debt.</p>

"170","2018-03-06","Business News: Bunge Faces Pressure on a Deal --- Continental Grain is poised to push the commodity-trading firm to weigh options","2010667531","Wall Street Journal","B.3","> investment firm Continental Grain Co. is preparing to push Bunge Ltd. to consider strategic options, ramping up pressure on the commodity-trading giant to strike a deal.</p>
<p>Continental Grain, which owns more than 1% of Bunge, on Monday secured approval from U.S. antitrust regulators to purchase more stock, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>That clearance would only be needed under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act if the firm intended to attempt to influence management. Such a filing is often a precursor to an activist campaign -- public or private.</p>
<p>Continental Grain's stake, and its intentions, hadn't previously been disclosed.</p>
<p>Bunge, which has a market value of about $10.7 billion, is in talks to sell itself to Archer Daniels Midland Co., according to people familiar with the discussions. Those talks, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, are progressing at a slow pace as the two sides try to iron out regulatory issues, the people said.</p>
<p>Mining conglomerate Glencore PLC, which has a grain-trading unit, last year confirmed it had separately approached Bunge about a deal. Glencore so far hadn't resurfaced, said some of the people, despite the mid-February expiration of a standstill agreement that prevented the Swiss company from launching a hostile bid for Bunge.</p>
<p>The three companies rank among the largest global buyers, traders and processors of crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat.</p>
<p>Bunge, based in White Plains, N.Y., in February reported that its net income last year dropped to $160 million from $745 million. The company's struggles have deepened some investors' frustration with its performance, and sharpened their interest in a potential deal.</p>
<p>Continental owns a top-15 stake in Bunge, equivalent to around 1.2%, and has been a long-term investor in the commodity trader, people familiar with the matter said. The firm notified regulators of its intent to engage more actively with Bunge's management on Feb. 14, the day Bunge reported its most recent quarterly results, one of the people said.</p>
<p>Continental has pressured companies in the past, including its attempt five years ago on Smithfield Foods Inc., when it launched a presentation for investors laying out Continental's case for breaking up the world's largest pork producer. Smithfield eventually agreed to sell itself to China's Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd., now known as WH Group, for $4.7 billion.</p>
<p>Besides Bunge, Continental also maintains investments in Wayne Farms LLC, a Georgia-based chicken processor, along with Chinese livestock feed producers and crop-processing facilities in South America.</p>
<p>Continental traces its roots back to a grain business founded in 1813, and has firsthand experience with big transactions in the crop-trading world. The company sold its grain-marketing business, then the second-largest exporter of U.S. grain, to Cargill Inc. in a deal valued around $1 billion in 1999. That sale helped transform Continental into an investment firm focused on the agricultural industry.</p>
<p>Other investors have signaled similar intentions to engage with Bunge's executives. Carlson Capital LP, Bunge's 10th-largest shareholder with about 1.46% of its stock, made a similar antitrust filing last June.</p>

"171","2018-03-07","U.S. Keeps Huawei in Its Sights --- Chinese equipment maker looms large in government review of bid for Qualcomm","2011185010","Wall Street Journal","B.1","> intervening this week in the Broadcom-Qualcomm takeover battle, the U.S. government also had its eye on another company: China's Huawei Technologies Co.</p>
<p>The world's top cellular-equipment maker and a leading smartphone brand, Huawei in the past three months has been the subject of a series of interventions, or attempted interventions, by the Trump administration and Congress across the telecommunications industry.</p>
<p>The latest was Washington's move this week to intervene in Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd.'s attempted hostile takeover of U.S.-based Qualcomm Inc. A government panel ordered Qualcomm to delay a shareholder vote that Broadcom hoped would elevate directors friendly to its $117 billion bid.</p>
<p>In a letter explaining its interference, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which reviews foreign takeovers for national-security concerns, cited its worry that China, specifically Huawei, could gain the upper hand in the development of so-called 5G technology.</p>
<p>Translation: Removing an able U.S. competitor to Huawei risks strengthening the Chinese company at the expense of the American wireless industry.</p>
<p>Broadcom on Tuesday tried to dispel those concerns. ""We are fully cooperating with CFIUS, and are absolutely committed to making the combined company a global leader in critical 5G and other technologies,"" a spokesman said in a statement.</p>
<p>5G is the next-generation mobile-network technology that the industry is preparing to roll out around the world. American officials and some Western telecom companies worry that if China implements 5G widely before the U.S. does, it could have a head start in technologies that the new networks' speed and capacity are expected to kick-start, like self-driving cars.</p>
<p>Some Washington policy makers and industry executives have suggested a deeper worry that, with Huawei's help, China could displace Silicon Valley as the world's innovation center and lure top engineers there. Another concern: If Huawei extends its lead in the telecom-equipment industry, American wireless carriers might have no choice but to use Huawei gear in the future.</p>
<p>Major American wireless carriers, such as AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., have said they are initially focusing 5G coverage in a few cities.""What I see in the U.S. is wireless carriers choosing particular geographic markets for 5G,"" said Gartner Inc. analyst Ian Keene. ""The way the Chinese are going to approach it, it's going to be blanketed.""</p>
<p>The extent to which the U.S. government shares that fear was laid bare in unusual clarity in the CFIUS letter. The committee said it would probe whether a Broadcom-Qualcomm tie-up would ""leave an opening for China to expand its influence on the 5G standard setting process."" It cited specifically Huawei's 5G ""engagement.""</p>
<p>Not everyone shares U.S. worries about Huawei. U.K.-based Vodafone Group PLC, the world's No. 2 wireless carrier by subscribers, said it worked ""very well"" with Huawei's equipment.</p>
<p>""They are a very innovative company. They are very open. We never found anything less than normal in the Huawei equipment and software,"" Vodafone Chief Executive Vittorio Colao said at a wireless-industry conference last week. ""It's not like the Cisco router is very different. It's made in China,"" he said, referring to telecom equipment made by one of Huawei's American rivals.</p>
<p>In the past decade, U.S. telecom companies such as Lucent and Motorola merged into foreign hands, leavingQualcomm as one of the few American powerhouses in the industry.</p>
<p>Huawei buys chips from and pays patent royalties to Qualcomm, and on Tuesday the two sides were close to an agreement to settle a patent-royalty dispute, according to people familiar with the matter. The two also fiercely compete for cellular patents. In that $14 billion-a-year industry, Qualcomm dominates. Both are leaders in the international consortium currently setting standards for 5G.</p>
<p>""When you look at the whole package -- the standards innovations, the hardware innovation, the impact on the industry from a technology perspective -- then yes, Qualcomm is the leader in 5G,"" said Bob DiFazio, vice president at wireless-technology developer InterDigital.</p>
<p>Concern over Huawei isn't new. Congress effectively barred major carriers from dealing in the company's equipment, after a 2012 report concluded Beijing could force Huawei to exploit its own equipment to spy or disable telecom networks.</p>
<p>A Huawei spokesman said the company is employee-owned, and that no government has ever asked it to spy on or sabotage operations in another country. The spokesman said the company was aware of U.S. government activities seemingly aimed at inhibiting its business, but that its poses no greater risk than other telecommunications-equipment companies, given they share a global supply chain.</p>
<p>Late last year, congressional pressure mounted on AT&T to drop plans to sell Huawei smartphones in the U.S. In a surprise reversal, the company did just that in January; it declined to cite a reason.</p>
<p>Then, a National Security Council official cited Huawei's dominant position in telecom equipment in a proposal to build a government-backed nationwide, 5G wireless network. After the proposal became public in January, drawing criticism from other government officials and the wireless industry, a Trump administration spokeswoman said it was only an early-stage idea.</p>
<p>In December, President Donald Trump signed a defense-spending bill that will ban equipment from Huawei and China's ZTE Corp. from the Defense Department's nuclear-weapon infrastructure.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>A Look at Deals</p>
<p>U.S. Discouraged</p>
<p>The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. over the years has frustrated a number of deals by citing national-security concerns -- as might happen with Broadcom Ltd.'s proposed $117 billion takeover of Qualcomm Inc. Here is a recent sampling.</p>
<p>-- UQM Technologies Inc., a Colorado company developing motors for electric cars, said Monday that China National Heavy Duty Truck Group Co. pulled a planned second investment in the firm, citing CFIUS concerns. The deal reached in August would have allowed the Chinese truck company, which has a 9.9% stake in UQM valued at $5.1 million, to increase its ownership stake to 34%. The two companies said they plan to re-submit an application for CFIUS to review.</p>
<p>-- Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group Co. last week canceled a plan to buy Waldo Genetics, a Nebraska-based seller of breeding pigs, after it said it failed to gain U.S. government approval. The company had struck a deal in March 2017 to buy Waldo for $16.5 million. Privately held Waldo didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>-- Xcerra Corp., a Norwood, Mass., provider of testing equipment for semiconductors and electronics, last month terminated its sale to a Chinese group, citing difficulty in securing CFIUS approval for the $580 million deal.</p>
<p>-- CFIUS declined to approve a $1.2 billion deal for Chinese billionaire Jack Ma's Ant Financial Services Group to buy MoneyGram International Inc., the companies said in January.</p>
<p>-- In September, President Donald Trump blocked an attempt by Chinese government-backed Canyon Bridge Capital Partners to buy Portland, Ore.-based Lattice Semiconductor Corp. after CFIUS recommended he block the deal.</p>
<p>-- Chinese conglomerate HNA Group Co. has been trying for some time to get approval from the panel to buy a controlling stake in SkyBridge Capital, the investment firm owned by former White House adviser Anthony Scaramucci.</p>
<p>-- A $2.7 billion deal for China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co. to buy Richmond, Va.-based insurer Genworth Financial Inc. also is awaiting clearance from the committee.</p>
<p>The outlook for foreign investment, especially Chinese, could get tougher if bipartisan bills introduced in November by Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R., Texas) and Rep. Robert Pittenger (R., N.C.) pass.</p>
<p>CFIUS, which is chaired by the Treasury Department, doesn't usually release its decisions or detail its deliberations. In a statement, the Treasury Department said it is prohibited by law from publicly disclosing information filed with the committee, saying its reviews focus on national-security concerns.</p>

"172","2018-03-27","His Brother's Keeper","2018483855","New York Times","B.1","> a former Microsoft executive decided to sell his collection of eight golf properties in Washington State, a small Chinese company started quietly negotiating for them.</p><p>The company, West Coast Golf, said it was working on behalf of wealthy Chinese investors, including a Hong Kong company. Then the talks stalled.</p><p>A year later, a big Chinese conglomerate, HNA Group, suddenly swooped in and agreed to pay $137 million to buy the properties from the former tech executive's company, Oki Golf.</p><p>The two Chinese companies had an important connection: The head of West Coast Golf, Wang Wei, is the younger brother of HNA's longtime co-chairman, Wang Jian.</p><p>The activities of Wang Wei have been central to HNA's transformation from a small regional airline to a vast global conglomerate, one with nearly $100 billion in revenue and stakes in Deutsche Bank, Hilton Hotels and Swissport.</p><p>For nearly 25 years, Mr. Wang has been a little-known force at HNA, working behind the scenes to orchestrate investments, build supply chains and transfer assets, according to a review of annual reports, court filings and corporate documents by The New York Times. In one of the most pivotal moves, Mr. Wang helped set the stage for a takeover of HNA by company insiders and their families -- a change that transferred control of a state-backed company into private hands.</p><p>In recent years, HNA emerged seemingly out of nowhere to become one of the most prolific dealmakers in the world, spending billions of dollars on acquisitions in real estate, finance and logistics. Investors and regulators in the United States, in Europe and elsewhere have been trying to understand the ambitions, operations and finances of the global behemoth -- and the players who have helped shape the company, including Wang Wei.</p><p>Those questions have taken on more urgency as Chinese authorities press the country's most aggressive acquisitors to pare back their debt. In a dramatic move, the Chinese government last month seized control of the Anbang Insurance Group, which owns the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City and other multibillion-dollar properties around the world.</p><p>In the current climate, HNA, which has amassed about $90 billion in debt, is reversing course and selling off assets. Other pending deals by the company remain in limbo.</p><p>Understanding HNA is difficult. The conglomerate controls a vast network of public and private companies, subsidiaries and affiliates spread across the world. Scores of them have business ties to the friends and family members of the company's senior executives.</p><p>A review by The Times found that few, if any, of those personal ties were disclosed to stock and bonds investors of the company's affiliates. Typically, investors want to understand such dealings, which could create conflicts of interest.</p><p>Whether Wang Wei was ever formally employed by HNA or its predecessor, Hainan Airlines, is unclear. A review of hundreds of company filings going back to the mid-1990s turned up only a handful of mentions of him by name, and none indicate that he is the younger brother of a top HNA executive. In some cases -- like the early negotiations for the Oki Golf deal -- the private investment firms of Wang Wei, or those of other relatives, operated behind the scenes.</p><p>""These transactions are carefully reviewed to ensure that they were in all respects beneficial to HNA,"" Thomas A. Clare, a lawyer for HNA, said in an email. ""Working with a business partner who is known to the company and its leadership allowed the parties to work collaboratively from a position of trust and cooperation and, in so doing, achieved even greater results.""</p><p>Calls to Mr. Wang's homes and offices were not returned.</p><p>For years, Mr. Wang was largely unknown as a businessman in China. He granted few media interviews and rarely posed for photographs. Even on Hainan Island, where he worked for more than a decade, he was mainly known for running a company that was trying to produce Cuban-style cigars.</p><p>Then roughly a decade ago, Mr. Wang appeared as a major investor in one of China's biggest property companies, Dalian Wanda. Records show that in July 2007, he bought a sizable stake in the family holding company of Wanda's chairman on the same day that a company controlled by the son of a member of the Communist Party's ruling Politburo took a stake in one of its subsidiaries. Another one of Wang Wei's investment firms bought a big stake in the Three Gorges Bank, in the city of Chongqing, in about 2008.</p><p>The roots of his wealth, though, are tied to HNA and Hainan Airlines.</p><p>After his brother Wang Jian helped found the state-backed Hainan Airlines in the early 1990s, the younger Mr. Wang became one of the company's frequent business partners. He set up joint ventures and other businesses to provide services to the airline, including advertising and leasing. He also helped the carrier move into golf, resorts and property development.</p><p>Between 1994 and 2010, Mr. Wang set up more than 30 companies that did business with HNA and its affiliates, according to corporate filings. One company, a software services firm called eKing, was acquired by HNA, which later sold a piece to private investors for $500 million.</p><p>In some deals, Mr. Wang started out managing a project on behalf of HNA before quietly taking ownership through another entity.</p><p>It happened with West Coast Golf.</p><p>In October 1996, Hainan Airlines invited some of the world's leading golf course designers, including a team working for the golf legend Jack Nicklaus, to help build an 18-hole golf course on a 350-acre plot of oceanfront property in Haikou, the capital of Hainan. When construction began, the winning design team was introduced to Wang Wei.</p><p>""He would attend all the meetings,"" said O'Brien McGarey, the president of the Dye Designs Group of Denver, which won the design competition. ""I never really understood what his role was, but I knew he was Wang Jian's younger brother. And it was Hainan Airlines that paid me.""</p><p>Later, records show, investment companies affiliated with Mr. Wang acquired majority ownership of West Coast Golf, which grew from a single golf course into a large property development with luxury villas.</p><p>It played out similarly when HNA wanted to build a more upscale development, a five-star hotel and resort surrounded by villas, on Hainan Island.</p><p>The architectural design team was hired by Hainan Airlines. But Wang Wei was involved in the planning. Mr. Wang eventually gained control of the development through one of his businesses, the Sunny Bay Development Company, according to corporate filings.</p><p>Today, the development site is home to one of the island's most expensive tourist destinations -- the Park Hyatt Sanya Sunny Bay Resort and a collection of luxury villas that each sell for more than $7 million. Caleb Wang, chief executive of the HTW Tourism Group, said that in 2005 his company bought a majority stake in the development site from Wang Wei.</p><p>""He is still a small shareholder,"" said the chief executive of HTW, who is not related to Mr. Wang. ""I've only met him once. He was here for the opening of the Park Hyatt.""</p><p>Wang Wei also has ties to one of HNA's biggest shareholders.</p><p>Beginning around 2000, a company managed by Mr. Wang built a stake in one of the airline's largest investors, a company called Hainan Qixing, with other HNA insiders that included his brother. The participation of HNA insiders does not appear to have been disclosed in public filings. Regulators in China and elsewhere often require disclosure of so-called related party deals involving senior executives or members of their families.</p><p>Through Qixing, Mr. Wang and company insiders restructured the state-backed airline into a privately held parent company called the HNA Group. A large portion of HNA's shares were then shifted offshore, to Pan American Aviation, a company registered in the Cayman Islands, according to a review of corporate filings in China and Hong Kong.</p><p>In recent months, United States regulators conducting a review of HNA acquisition have pressed the conglomerate to explain its corporate ownership structure, according to court papers filed in an American lawsuit.</p><p>As HNA grew into a global powerhouse, Wang Wei went global, too.</p><p>When Hainan Airlines was expanding, it needed to procure goods like jet fuel, aircrafts and spare parts from foreign companies, including Boeing, General Electric and Mitsubishi of Japan. Hainan Airlines formed a series of companies inside and outside China to help source these goods and ship them into the country, for a fee.</p><p>One of the companies set up to work with the airline was the Hainan HNA Import &amp; Export Company, a firm partly controlled by Wang Wei, his brother Wang Jian and a group of their longtime business associates, according to corporate records. The import company, in other words, gave the Wang brothers an interest in the company's purchase of overseas goods, giving them a stake in a business that apparently was not disclosed to investors in Hainan Airlines, a listed company.</p><p>Mr. Wang's ties to HNA and its top executives run deep. In 2007, he bought what is now a $5 million residence near Seattle from a company controlled by HNA's co-chairman, Chen Feng. Then, Mr. Wang's daughter registered two limited liability companies in the city.</p><p>One of those companies helped West Coast Golf initiate talks to acquire the Oki Golf properties.</p><p>In the summer of 2014, one of Mr. Wang's associates asked for help locating golf facilities in the United States, according to Mr. McGarey, the Denver-based golf course designer who had begun working with Wang Wei in the mid-1990s.</p><p>Mr. McGarey said that he had negotiated an agreement, which included a ""success fee,"" and then signed a contract with Mr. Wang's West Coast Golf. The document, he said, was reviewed by HNA lawyers on behalf of West Coast Golf. Soon after, he was put in touch with Mr. Wang's son-in-law in Seattle, Mike Ji. They began scouting golf courses in Washington State.</p><p>When they settled on Oki Golf as a prospect, Mr. McGarey brought in two advisers to help with the assessment of Oki's courses: Dan Conway and Don Lewison.</p><p>Together, they approached Scott Oki, the former Microsoft executive who owned Oki Golf.</p><p>""I got a hold of Scott Oki. He lives across the street from me,"" Mr. Lewison, a Seattle real estate broker, recalled. ""We met in my house, over coffee and doughnuts. I told him we had a friend who had Chinese clients, and he told me he might want to sell to them.""</p><p>Negotiations got underway quickly -- but by the end of 2015, the American advisers said the talks appeared to have gone nowhere.</p><p>Then in October 2016, Oki Golf announced that it had agreed to sell a collection of courses to the HNA Group for $137 million in cash. Mr. Oki and HNA declined to comment on the deal.</p><p>Mr. McGarey said he and the two advisers were cut out of the deal -- and the fees promised in the contract with West Coast Golf.</p><p>""His son-in-law Mike Ji called me after the deal was announced, and said, 'HNA was the buyer, and it had nothing to do with Wang Wei.""' Mr. McGarey recalled. ""I was furious. This deal definitely goes back to Wang Wei.""</p><p>Credit: DAVID BARBOZA and MICHAEL FORSYTHE; Tiffany May and Alan Wong contributed reporting.

"173","2018-04-07","Kushners Will Buy Rest of 666 Fifth Ave., Partner Says in Filing","2022485434","New York Times","A.17","> Kushner family appeared on Friday to have struck a deal to buy out its partner in the troubled Fifth Avenue skyscraper at the center of its real estate empire, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>The Kushners' partner, the publicly traded Vornado Realty Trust, has indicated for months that it was interested in selling its stake in the building, and on Friday, Steven Roth, Vornado's chairman, said in the filing that it had reached a handshake deal ""to sell our interest to our partner.""</p><p>The Kushners have attracted enormous public attention because of their connection to President Trump. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law, was chief executive of the company until he joined the White House last year as one of Mr. Trump's key advisers.</p><p>The Kushners have spent the last three years on a worldwide hunt for a new partner and financing to build either a new super-tower designed by the architect Zaha Hadid on the site of 666 Fifth Avenue, near Rockefeller Center, or to renovate and reposition the 41-story, aluminum-clad tower as a first-class building.</p><p>Mr. Kushner's father, Charles Kushner, has scrambled to find partners to bail out its investment in the building, which also serves as the headquarters of Kushner Companies. The company has a $1.4 billion mortgage on the building that is due in 10 months. Real estate analysts doubt that the office space is worth that much, making a traditional refinancing of the building problematic.</p><p>The Kushners tried to make a deal with  Anbang Insurance Group, a giant Chinese insurance company with ties to some of the Communist Party's leading families, but those talks fell apart last year amid heightened scrutiny of the link to Mr. Trump.</p><p>Charles Kushner also sought a $500 million investment from the former prime minister of Qatar, according to The Intercept, the online news site. That entreaty was also unsuccessful.</p><p>The negotiations have drawn scrutiny because Jared Kushner's White House responsibilities involve both China and the Middle East.</p><p>It is unclear if the announcement from Vornado means the Kushners have found a new partner, or who might be providing the financing for such a deal.</p><p>Vornado declined further comment through a spokeswoman. A spokeswoman for Kushner Companies said Charles Kushner, an Orthodox Jew, was unavailable to comment because he was observing the Sabbath.</p><p>The Kushners made a huge splash in 2007 when they bought 666 Fifth for $1.8 billion, setting a record price for an office tower. Before then, Mr. Kushner was known mainly as a developer of garden apartments in New Jersey, where he lived, and a major Democratic Party contributor.</p><p>The Fifth Avenue building was meant to signal a significant change in direction for the Kushners, who moved into Manhattan, installed the family headquarters on the building's 15th floor and went on a real estate shopping spree that has left them with properties in Brooklyn, Jersey City and Maryland.</p><p>But 666 Fifth was bought mostly with borrowed money. To pay off some of the debt, the Kushners sold the building's most valuable asset, the retail space, to Carlyle Group and Crown Acquisitions for $525 million.</p><p>The family had expected to boost rents in the building. But as the 2008 recession set in, the building lost some of its largest tenants and the financial bleeding started. Fearing a possible default, its lender appointed a ""special servicer"" to oversee the building.</p><p>In 2011, the Kushners sought to restructure their debt. Vornado bought a 49.5 percent interest in the building's office space and agreed to invest up to $80 million and take responsibility for a portion of the mortgage. The mortgage was divided into a $1.1 billion note and a $115 million secondary loan.</p><p>But Vornado imposed stiff terms. It was getting 11 percent interest on money it actually invested in the building, and a 3 percent return on the remaining money, if any, according to a financial report from Trepp, a company that tracks real estate debt.</p><p>The mortgage has swelled to $1.4 billion with accrued interest. The partners have been forced to cover shortfalls on the mortgage payments. And Vornado subsequently bought much of the retail space along Fifth Avenue from Crown and Carlyle for $707 million, except for a portion owned by Zara, the Spanish clothing chain. Vornado is expected to hang onto the retail space.</p><p>In the filing Mr. Roth said the price Vornado was receiving would repay the company's investment: ""The existing loan will be repaid including payment to us of the portion of the debt we hold.""</p><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""Photograph"" /><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""Y"" /><div class=""Photograph_content""><photo_caption>The Kushners bought 666 Fifth Avenue just before the 2008 recession, and the building's finances have been troubled ever since.

"174","2018-05-22","HP Tackles Stagnant PC Market --- Emphasis on designs and game machines helps bolster revenue at hardware maker","2042007846","Wall Street Journal","B.4","> after Dion Weisler took over Hewlett-Packard Co.'s computer business in 2013, he assembled his charges to survey nearly 40 of its PCs, a hodgepodge of styles, sizes and colors splayed out in a conference room. He wanted the employees to feel embarrassed.</p>
<p>""There was nothing quite as telling as having the whole portfolio on a great big table and forcing our team to look at it,"" said Mr. Weisler in a recent interview. He became chief executive of HP Inc., the personal-computer and printer business that emerged from the carving of Hewlett-Packard into two pieces in 2015.</p>
<p>By focusing on sleeker designs and high-performance game machines, HP managed to boost revenue and gobble market share from smaller competitors even as the PC market shrank. The bet has paid off so far, sending HP's stock up 77% since the company's split.</p>
<p>With the stagnant PC market largely condensed into a handful of giants, the questions for HP are how long it can make the formula last and what comes next.</p>
<p>HP is set to report fiscal second-quarter results on May 29. Analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence expect revenue growth of 10% to $13.58 billion, with adjusted per-share earnings up 20% at 48 cents.</p>
<p>When Hewlett-Packard split in 2015, pundits figured HP Inc. would be the runt of the litter, while sibling Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. was freed to focus on more attractive markets such as selling corporate technology services. In the U.S., only Apple Inc. has thrived selling hardware, doing so by innovating with smartphones.</p>
<p>Mr. Weisler was stuck in shrinking markets with a musty hardware brand at the same time much of tech's growth was generated by internet companies selling services, such as Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google. Today, even Apple emphasizes the growth of its services businesses.</p>
<p>Unio Capital LLC, which holds $5.2 million in HP stock, or about 4.5% of its portfolio, believes there is still vitality in the PC business as employers value gains in worker productivity, said John Allison, the New York asset-management firm's CEO.</p>
<p>""We think this is a company that is reinventing itself, so the growth is going to come,"" he said.</p>
<p>Even though the number of PCs shipped annually world-wide has dropped 9.1% since Hewlett-Packard's split, HP's annual PC shipments have climbed 5%, according to market-research firm Gartner Inc. Last year, HP leapfrogged Lenovo Group Ltd. to become the top PC seller in the world with 21% share of the global market, up from 18.2% in 2015.</p>
<p>In that time, HP's annual revenue from its PC business has increased 6% and its operating profit has climbed 9%, helping to buffer an 11% drop in revenue and an 18% tumble in operating profit at its printing business.</p>
<p>A reckoning could still be in store. When Mr. Weisler took over the PC business, the top five PC makers held 59% of the global market, according to Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. By last year, it was 71%. HP's top PC rivals -- Lenovo, Dell Technologies Inc., Asustek Computer Inc. and Acer Inc. -- have all expanded their market share as well. Mr. Sacconaghi said he expects the major PC makers to seize about 85% of the market share ""over time.""</p>
<p>HP's market-share gains will be difficult to sustain, said Mikako Kitagawa, an analyst at Gartner, which expects PC shipments to be flat in 2018 and decline about 6% by 2021.</p>
<p>Mr. Weisler acknowledged consolidation will continue, but he expects HP to take share from bigger rivals.</p>
<p>To do so, HP started using premium materials to make its PCs more appealing and introduced technologies such as one that dims a laptop screen's visible light when viewed from an angle, so nosy neighbors can't snoop.</p>
<p>Much of HP's success comes from making PCs ""sexy"" again, including laptops that convert to tablet computers, said Scott DeTota, a vice president at CDW Corp., which sells tech products to businesses.</p>
<p>Mr. Weisler said he has focused HP less on entry-level PCs and toward higher-margin businesses such as game machines. HP launched a new brand, Omen, in 2016. An Omen PC with the priciest components can cost more than $6,000.</p>
<p>Game PCs are a $1 billion-a-year business for HP, Mr. Weisler said. That is still a relatively small piece of HP's overall PC business, which totaled $33.37 billion in its latest fiscal year. But to Mr. Weisler, it represents the kinds of moves HP needs to make in a contracting market.</p>

"175","2019-06-22","EXCHANGE --- Business News: Bidders On Hotel Portfolio Thin Out","2244518279","Wall Street Journal","B.3",">
<p>The field of investor groups bidding for the luxury-hotel portfolio owned by a Chinese insurer has narrowed to about a half dozen, with bids ranging from about $5.5 billion to $5.8 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Blackstone Group LP, Brookfield Asset Management and Mirae Asset Management, part of a South Korean financial-services company, are among the current bidders, these people said. The number of bidders is down from nearly 20 groups that expressed interest, these people said.</p>

<p>China's Anbang Insurance Group Co. is looking to unload a luxury-hotel collection that it acquired for $5.5 billion about three years ago from Blackstone, as pressure builds on the company to raise cash following its seizure by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>A representative for Anbang declined to comment</p>
<p>The portfolio includes 15 high-end properties, among them Essex House Hotel overlooking Manhattan's Central Park, the Four Seasons Hotel in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and the Fairmont in Chicago.</p>
<p>Anbang was at the center of a wave of Chinese insurers and other investors who went on a U.S. real-estate buying spree, taking advantage of new rules that allowed them to invest more easily abroad. Chinese companies, like HNA Group Co. and Greenland Holding Group, scooped up trophy assets in big U.S. cities.</p>
<p>In 2015, Anbang paid $1.95 billion for New York's landmark Waldorf Astoria hotel -- the highest price ever for a U.S. hotel. The property, which isn't part of the portfolio Anbang bought from Blackstone, currently is closed as it undergoes a massive renovation.</p>
<p>Anbang isn't including the Waldorf in the hotel portfolio it is selling, and the insurer is in the process of converting hundreds of rooms into condos for sale.</p>

"176","2019-11-05","Banking &amp; Finance: Chinese Deal for Insurer Drags Out for Three Years","2311855523","Wall Street Journal","B.10",">
<p>A Chinese conglomerate's planned $2.7 billion takeover of U.S. insurer Genworth Financial Inc. has yet to close more than three years after it was announced, making it one of the longest engagements in recent deal history.</p>
<p>The uncompleted transaction has tested the patience of company executives, investors and regulators. One U.S. analyst recently referred to it as a ""zombie"" merger deal. The closing has taken so long that Genworth said some regulatory approvals it had earlier received have lapsed and that the companies would need to reapply for them.</p>

<p>""We fully understand how challenging it has been for our shareholders and stakeholders, given the merger agreement was signed three years ago,"" Thomas McInerney, president and chief executive of Genworth, said on the insurer's third-quarter earnings call after it reported lower net income for the period. Genworth said an adjusted measure of operating income rose from a year earlier.</p>
<p>The takeover of Genworth by Beijing-based China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co. was supposed to give the Richmond, Va., provider of mortgage, life and long-term-care insurance a much-needed financial boost. Years of low interest rates have crimped the profitability of Genworth's business of providing long-term-care coverage for Americans, who are living longer.</p>
<p>The deal took place when large Chinese conglomerates were collecting trophy assets overseas and were flush with cash and cheap financing. The deal was one of the largest Chinese acquisitions to pass a national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S.</p>
<p>China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange and regulators in Canada, where Genworth has operations, have yet to give it the green light.</p>
<p>While Canadian regulators recently indicated they intend to approve a sale of Genworth's Canada business, there has been no word from the Chinese agency.</p>
<p>Some analysts say the main hurdle to the deal's completion is that much of China Oceanwide's money is stuck in China.</p>
<p>The Chinese agency has to clear any large funds transfer that would require the conversion of yuan into other currencies. Under the $2.7 billion cash deal for Genworth, China Oceanwide agreed to provide funds to boost the insurer's capital and reduce debt.</p>
<p>Analysts from research firm CreditSights said in late October that a no-deal scenario was becoming increasingly likely. They added that it isn't clear whether the delay is related to the U.S.-China trade war or something about China Oceanwide in particular.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, Chinese authorities have increased scrutiny of overseas acquisitions and investments made by the country's largest private companies, especially those funded with debt. Tighter credit conditions and China's economic slowdown have also crimped the growth ambitions of once-highflying Chinese conglomerates.</p>
<p>China Oceanwide has domestic and overseas investments in property, financial-services businesses and power plants, and has experienced revenue and profit declines since 2016, in part because of lower real-estate sales.</p>
<p>Genworth plans to seek reapproval for the deal from the New York State Department of Financial Services, after the approval expired.</p>

But in the case of Pfizer Inc.'s sale of a Chinese business, it highlights the growing influence of China's government over Western mergers and acquisitions.</p>              <p>Pfizer this week sold its Chinese swine-vaccine business to a subsidiary of a Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Co., which is based in China's northeast.</p>              <p>The transaction was designed to comply with a Chinese Ministry of Commerce antimonopoly review last year of Pfizer's merger with Wyeth. It offers more evidence of how Beijing intends to use its 2008 antimonopoly law to influence cross-border merger plans, a new hurdle for global deals.</p>              <p>Beijing is now interceding in mergers in a way similar to that of the U.S. and the European Union, which also required Pfizer to divest certain animal-health operations in their merger reviews.</p>              <p>Since the antimonopoly rules went into force almost two years ago, China has set conditions on at least five other big transactions, blocking one of them: Coca-Cola Co.'s $2.4 billion bid for a Chinese juice maker.</p>              <p>One Western lawyer who has worked in China for years said the country is becoming the ""third pole of the antitrust review universe,"" even in deals where China's market is minimal. The Commerce Ministry is referred to as ""MofCom.""</p>              <p>MofCom determined that the combination of the two U.S. pharmaceutical makers would leave the merged firm in control of nearly half the Chinese market for certain swine vaccines, a lucrative niche in a nation of 500 million pigs.</p>              <p>The Pfizer deal is believed to be the first in which China required divestment of a local business.</p>              <p>The ministry didn't respond to a request for comment. A Pfizer spokeswoman said the divestiture was part of the regulatory approval process, but declined further comment.</p>              <p>Investment bankers said Harbin Pharmaceutical offered the highest price for the Pfizer business, which also attracted interest from Novartis AG and Eli Lily &amp; Co. Both Novartis and Eli Lilly declined to comment.</p>              <p>Yet, parameters set by the Commerce Ministry may also have made it most likely a Chinese buyer would emerge, people involved in the transaction said.</p>              <p>""There will be a lot of similar cases in the future,"" said Euan Rellie, a New York-based senior managing director of Business Development Asia LLC, an investment bank that represented Pfizer.</p>              <p>""Chinese authorities will use the new antitrust regulatory controls to protect emerging local players from what China sees as dominant international companies,"" he said.</p>              <p>The deal is narrow, relating to the technology for making and selling to China branded vaccines to combat mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, a strain of pig pneumonia.</p>              <p>The recent H1N1 influenza outbreak in humans, which was initially described as ""swine flu,"" is a type A influenza but different from influenzas found in pigs, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>              <p>Harbin Pharmaceutical will have access and training for three years to the Pfizer facility in Nebraska that produces and sells the vaccines and where its staff will be trained, a person familiar with the transaction said. The technology could provide Harbin Pharmaceuticals a launch pad to produce other types of animal medicine.</p>              <p>The buyer is about 45% owned by an arm of the Harbin city government, as well as 22.5% by each of the U.S. private-equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC and Beijing-based Citic Capital Holdings Ltd., itself a venture of the country's sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp. and state investment giant Citic Group.</p>              <p>""There's an open debate on whether MofCom is trying to protect domestic industry,"" said Ted Henneberry, a partner and antitrust specialist at Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe LLP, who wasn't involved in the Pfizer deal.</p>              <p>""But using these tools as a remedy would be looked upon favorably by companies that MofCom will try and fix things rather than just say no,"" he said.</p>              <p><object class=""mstar_link_to_media""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""6""/><param name=""mstar_lm_alignment"" value=""Left""/><param name=""mstar_lm_display_control"" value=""Embed""/><param name=""mstar_lm_pred_equation"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_type"" value=""Illustration""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_id"" value=""1""/></object></p>              <p>Credit: By James T.

An acquisition of BP would give PetroChina access to 18 billion barrels of oil reserves around the world -- a huge boost to its overseas supplies.</p>              <p>Standard Chartered said in its report that there were ""persuasive economics"" involved in the deal, although the chances of it actually happening were slim.</p>              <p>That skepticism, of course, is grounded in the fact that U.S. regulators aren't likely to look kindly at a Chinese oil company becoming the largest offshore oil producer in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>              <p>Politically, a PetroChina-BP deal would about as easy to digest as the tar balls washing up on Louisiana beaches. Remember what happened when Cnooc tried to buy California's Unocal for $18.5 billion in 2005? Back then, U.S. politicians worried about Chinese influence on world energy supplies, and nationalistic sentiments have only gotten stronger amid today's difficult economy.</p>              <p>Also, U.K. retirees, who own many BP shares through their pension funds, are unlikely to rejoice about having new Chinese owners. That likely pushback would mean any deal would need to be for cash only.</p>              <p>Earlier this week, Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil were being mentioned as possible suitors for badly battered BP, which is facing questions about its ability to survive the fallout from the spill.</p>              <p>Through Wednesday, it had lost more than half of its market value, shedding $82 billion since the spill began nearly two months ago.</p>              <p>BP's American depositary shares were up 12% at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday, at $32.78, after falling nearly 16% Wednesday.</p>              <p>Credit: By Michael Corkery</p>                      "

Exhibit A is the flap over Beijing-based Lenovo Group Ltd.'s plan to acquire a unit of International Business Machines Corp.</p>              <p>The deal would be a milestone in trans-Pacific commerce: the first billion-dollar takeover in the U.S. by a mainland Chinese company. The high-level Bush-administration review of Lenovo's plan to buy IBM's personal-computer unit -- prompted by three top congressional Republicans worried about Lenovo's close ties to the authoritarian government -- shows Americans won't take that new era lightly.</p>              <p>""It is an icon of American business,"" says Michael Wessel, a deal skeptic who sits on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. The bipartisan panel examines China issues and advises Congress. ""It's a symbol of China's coming of age,"" he adds.</p>              <p>Others see the controversy as protectionist backlash. The issue is mainly a ""concern of U.S. isolationist forces who oppose globalization and economic integration,"" Paul Denlinger, founder of China Business Strategy, a consulting firm that helps companies crack the Chinese market, wrote in a recent essay.</p>              <p>The intensifying fears have parallels with those a decade ago of a Japanese economic takeover -- but with an overlay of military and ideological tension. Japan was a free-market democracy staunchly allied with the U.S., while China's blend of communism and capitalism, and its own geopolitical ambitions and nuclear arsenal, make many Americans nervous.</p>              <p>""Essentially, it is the Chinese government that is the buyer of this company,"" says Rep. Donald Manzullo (R-Ill.), chairman of the House Small Business Committee. ""My concern here is that we're going to reach a point where economic security becomes an issue of national security.""</p>              <p>The acquisition appears to be part of a new trend. For years, China gobbled up U.S. bonds and stocks with hard currency. In 2004, the government of China's foreign-exchange holdings topped $600 billion and more than 70% of that was in U.S. government-affiliated bonds and securities, says Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, who tracks official Chinese statistics.</p>              <p>China's direct investment in American corporate assets has historically been much lower -- a little more than $300 million at the end of 2003, by the latest U.S. government estimate -- but the pace appears to be quickening. The Lenovo deal was one of a total of 22 Chinese acquisitions announced in the U.S. market in 2004, double the deals announced in 2003, according to Thomson Financial, the market- research firm.</p>              <p>In August, Sinopec International Petroleum, of Beijing, spent $150 million on First International Oil Co., a U.S. firm with energy holdings in Kazakhstan. In December, Eye Care Centers of America, of San Antonio, was acquired for $450 million by a Hong Kong eyewear firm and a San Francisco investment company. And the China National Offshore Oil Corp. is reportedly considering a $13 billion bid for Unocal Corp., an El Segundo, California, energy company.</p>              <p>On the way to becoming an export powerhouse -- and to a $100 billion-plus trade surplus with the U.S. -- Beijing has drawn howls about unfair practices. One of the biggest complaints is that China, which for years has resisted calls to let the yuan float free, is keeping its currency too low and making its goods artificially cheap on world markets.</p>              <p>""What's going on in Washington is people are getting fed up with the Chinese,"" says Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat sponsoring legislation pressuring China to revalue its currency.</p>              <p>Unlike Japan during the 1980s and early 1990s, China's economy has been fairly open to U.S. investment. But moves by U.S. companies to set up factories in the mainland have triggered complaints about the ""outsourcing"" of American jobs overseas.</p>              <p>Now, as Chinese companies eye U.S. assets more acquisitively, fears are on the rise about the possible loss of economic power and the transfer of technology to a potentially hostile nation.</p>              <p>Such concerns have long hung over U.S.-Sino relations. Indeed, the only time that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) -- the three-decade-old federal-government group reviewing the Lenovo deal -- has ever formally blocked a purchase was in 1990, when President George H.W. Bush stopped the sale of a Seattle aircraft- parts maker to China. In 2003, a Hong Kong conglomerate backed out of a bid to take a stake in Global Crossing Ltd. after CFIUS launched a review over worries about a Chinese magnate controlling the company's global undersea communications network.</p>              <p>The high-tech worries often blur quickly from commercial to security concerns. During the late 1990s, the People's Republic was accused of obtaining U.S. nuclear secrets, spurring a tightening of security at the nation's nuclear labs. And the Bush administration has repeatedly sanctioned Chinese companies for trading with Iran, a country it accuses of illicitly pursuing a nuclear weapon.</p>              <p>The State Department's top proliferation expert, and a leading administration hawk, John Bolton, vowed this week that the Bush administration will keep up pressure on China to ""help change the way China and other countries with proliferation problems behave."" Mr. Bolton noted the administration sanctioned Chinese entities a total of 62 times, far more than the eight sanctions imposed during President Clinton's eight years in office. Mr. Bolton's speech, one of the bluntest critiques of Chinese behavior heard from the administration, was also directed at the European Union.</p>              <p>Critics of the Lenovo deal wonder whether it will give China access to domestic technology that could be adapted for military purposes. Lenovo officials say the transaction isn't a security threat. And IBM -- which has a big stake in shedding the money-losing PC unit -- is working in Washington to tamp down concerns.</p>              <p>Some U.S. officials also fear the deal would give China a toehold in the corporate world from which they could conduct industrial espionage. Lenovo was launched in the mid-1980s with an investment from the state-controlled Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the academy would retain a 30% stake in the newly organized company; IBM would have an 18.9% stake.</p>              <p>The multi-agency review, led by the U.S. Treasury Department, is scheduled to be completed in mid-March. Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America, a U.S. tech trade group, says he would be surprised if the administration bars the deal. ""At the end of the day, it's a commodity product,"" he says.</p>              <p>But for politicians like Mr. Manzullo, the transaction fuses the panoply of fears about China.

House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Joe Barton of Texas sent a letter to President Bush calling on the White House to block the move. ""We urge you to protect American national security by ensuring that vital U.S. energy assets are never sold to the Chinese government,"" Mr. Barton wrote.</p>              <p>In the Senate, Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R., N.M.) said he doesn't like ""a government-owned company buying a U.S. oil company."" He added: ""If we could do something to stop it without the expectation that it would cause America real harm, I would be for trying to stop it.""</p>              <p>Still, the House resolution wouldn't be binding on the Bush administration, and there is little Congress can do to stop the acquisition if the companies agree to it. ""I don't know what Congress can do,"" acknowledged newly installed U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman.</p>              <p>But by raising their voices, lawmakers appear to be increasing pressure on the administration to aggressively use the principal mechanism for reviewing the merger: the multiagency process known as the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, or CFIUS. The committee, headed by the Treasury secretary and empowered under a 1988 statute, reviews foreign acquisitions for national-security concerns.</p>              <p>Yesterday, Unocal and Cnooc representatives met at the offices of Unocal attorneys Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz; at the top of the agenda were concerns over CFIUS approval as well as clearing up a number of items in the merger agreement submitted by Cnooc to the Unocal board, according to a person familiar with the matter. So far, this person said, Unocal has kept a conservative stance, concerned about the risk of being stuck without any deal, and is trying to move relatively quickly in deciding whether Cnooc's offer is superior to one from Chevron Corp., though it was hard to predict when a decision would be made.</p>              <p>On Capitol Hill, the flurry of activity reflects mounting unease about Cnooc's bid. But many of the Republican leaders' business allies are leery about U.S. government interference in the proposed merger. American companies have invested freely and profitably in China, and many worry about a backlash against U.S. investment there if Chinese investment in the U.S. is blocked.</p>                      "

In addition, the House may vote as early as today on a budget amendment that seeks to bar the Treasury Department from taking any action approving Unocal's sale to Cnooc.</p>              <p>Chevron's strategy seems to be: Make Cnooc's bid appear destined for a rigorous and lengthy regulatory review. That, in turn, could make Chevron's fast-track bid preferable to Unocal shareholders, even though Chevron is offering less money.</p>              <p>""Why not focus shareholders on the fact that there is a lot of uncertainty about Cnooc's ability to close? If I'm Chevron, that is the cheapest and most expeditious way to go,"" said Claire Farley, chief executive of Randall &amp; Dewey, an energy-advisory firm that is part of investment bank Jefferies Group Inc.</p>              <p>While Cnooc has marshaled its own team, including the law firm Akin Gump and the communications firm Public Strategies Inc., the unfolding fight underscores Chevron's advantages in the nation's capital. The San Ramon, Calif., company has deep political roots and an established reputation. Its board is salted with political heavyweights: Carla Hills, the U.S. trade representative during the first Bush presidency, who retains close ties to the current White House; and former Sen. Sam Nunn, a moderate Georgia Democrat respected in both parties on national-security issues.</p>              <p>Moreover, Chevron has been able to tap into a rising protectionist stance in Washington amid heightened concern over China's rise as an economic power. To help spread its message, Chevron is deploying former government insiders like Wayne Berman of the Federalist Group, a Commerce Department official during the first Bush administration and a big fund-raiser for the current President Bush. Another Federalist Group staffer, Drew Maloney, a former top aide to Texas Republican Rep. Tom DeLay, the House majority leader, also is pressing Chevron's case on Capitol Hill.</p>              <p>The Chevron lobbyists plot strategy daily on an 8:30 a.m. conference call led by Lisa Barry, the company's general manager for government affairs, according to a person with knowledge of the process. Ms. Barry previously held senior positions at Time Warner Inc. and the Commerce Department. Donald Campbell, a spokesman for Chevron, said, ""We do not comment on meetings or discussions we have in Washington.""</p>              <p>Lost in the all the rhetoric beginning to pour out of Washington is that a Cnooc acquisition of Unocal, based in El Segundo, Calif., would be unlikely to have much of an effect on global energy markets. Unocal's best assets -- oil and natural-gas fields in Asia -- represent a very small percentage of global production and much of the energy produced from these fields would likely be bought by the Chinese regardless of which company owns them.</p>              <p>If Cnooc reaches a deal with Unocal, the pact will face scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investments in the U.S., or CFIUS. Headed by Treasury Secretary John Snow, the interagency panel reviews acquisitions for potential national-security concerns and advises the president.</p>              <p>Chevron allies in Washington began churning the regulatory waters even before Cnooc announced its bid June 22. Several days earlier, two Republican congressmen called on President Bush to review any Cnooc bid. The letter cautioned that American companies would find it difficult to compete against Chinese companies that had the financial backing of the Chinese government. One of the congressmen was Rep. Richard Pombo, who represents a suburban San Francisco district that includes Chevron's headquarters.</p>              <p>A few days later, William Jefferson, a Democratic congressman from Louisiana, circulated a letter on Capitol Hill that emphasizes the fears about China echoing in Washington.</p>              <p>He was targeted by Chevron lobbyists early on as a potential ally. The lobbyists provided information about the bid, but Jefferson aides stress that the congressman began working on the anti-Cnooc letter before Chevron reached out to the office. ""They have been in my office,"" said Rep. Jefferson, adding he hasn't met personally with Chevron representatives. ""Our interest is larger than Chevron's. Our interest is whether we have a fair playing field, not just for Chevron but for everybody in the energy business.""</p>              <p>Mr. Jefferson's letter has been signed by 50 members of the House. The letter urges the administration to investigate -- as part of any review of the transaction by CFIUS -- whether Beijing is helping to finance Cnooc acquisitions, and whether those acquisitions are subsidized unfairly. ""Here we have the Chinese government, essentially, organizing this strategy,"" said Mr. Jefferson. ""Their idea is not to compete on the world market; they're looking to corner it, so it isn't available to anyone else. ... It's quite worrisome.""</p>              <p>In response to the letter, Cnooc Chairman and Chief Executive Fu Chengyu wrote a letter to members of Congress saying he welcomed a thorough review.</p>              <p>Upping the ante, on Monday two Texas Republicans, Reps. Joe Barton and Ralph Hall, sent a letter to President Bush urging him to prevent the sale. ""The Chinese are great economic and political rivals, not friendly competitors or allies in democracy,"" they wrote.</p>              <p>The Beltway battle is likely to only be the first stage in a protracted fight. Either suitor -- or both -- could sweeten their bids in an attempt to sway Unocal shareholders and directors. Unocal shareholders are scheduled to vote on the Chevron deal Aug. 10, which means Chevron can promise a completed deal in just six weeks, whereas a Cnooc acquisition could take months.</p>              <p>In an apparent attempt to boost its stock price -- and increase the value of its bid -- Chevron yesterday issued an interim update on its second-quarter production. The restart of a Gulf of Mexico platform that was badly damaged by Hurricane Ivan last year is helping boost oil production, it said. Margins at its refineries, particularly on the West Coast, were also strong.</p>              <p>Congressional pressure could shape the debate within the administration, giving political impetus to administration members concerned about China's rise. Six months ago, pressure from House critics prompted the administration to extend a review of International Business Machines Corp.'s sale of its personal-computing unit to Lenovo Group Ltd., a Chinese firm. Ultimately, the administration forced changes in the IBM-Lenovo deal.</p>              <p>If Chevron prevails, however, it may pay a price for helping stir up protectionist fervor in Washington. The company's Caltex unit has extensive refining and marketing operations throughout Southeast Asia that could be vulnerable if China retaliates. ""They could ultimately regret having unleashed those forces they can't control,"" said Tom Petrie, co-founder of Petrie Parkman &amp; Co., an energy investment bank. ""There is a second-order consequence to winning with protectionism because of the exposure they have to the Asian markets through Caltex.

If Lenovo were to follow through with its negotiations and buy IBM's PC operation, it would gain considerable heft. But it's unclear how the company would otherwise benefit from a business IBM wants to shed because of a history of losses.</p>              <p>Lenovo is a company in transition, scrambling for a growth strategy as it is being attacked on its home turf. For the past two years Lenovo has been losing domestic market share to multinational manufacturers, whose technical sophistication is winning over customers. The Chinese PC market is now the world's second-largest after the United States.</p>              <p>Lenovo early this year undertook a major restructuring to cope with that threat. It began selling directly to some large customers, as Dell does, though in small quantities so far. And it cast aside a two- year-old strategy to boost revenue by diversifying into technology services and contract manufacturing, a retrenchment that prompted layoffs. Executives said last month they don't expect the changes to pay off with improved profits until next year.</p>              <p>The failure of the diversification strategy leaves the company with little choice but to look overseas for growth, says analyst Kirk Yang of Citigroup Smith Barney in a research note. ""If they don't go out of China, they'll miss 90% of the PC market,"" he says. On the other hand, the company could get bogged down in trying to make such a large acquisition work, further distracting it from fending off rivals at home.</p>              <p>The success of any deal with IBM would hinge on its structure, of course, and there's a chance that no deal will be reached. A spokeswoman for Lenovo says the company has no comment on reports that the two were negotiating a deal, discussions that earlier were reported by the New York Times. Last month, when the company reported quarterly results, Lenovo Chairman Liu Chuanzhi said ""globalization is one of our long-term goals."" IBM also has declined to comment on the reports.</p>              <p>Lenovo's predicament -- the company is untested abroad and under siege at home -- is increasingly common in China. Yet Lenovo brings considerable resources to the challenge. The company is one of the first commercial spinoffs from China's extensive research establishment. Its original parent, the government's Chinese Academy of Sciences is still a major shareholder, ensuring Lenovo's access to loans from state banks.</p>              <p>Mr. Liu, who founded the company and still runs it, has in the past risen to challenging circumstances. In response to demands from the Chinese Academy of Sciences to churn out more competitive products and push out foreign suppliers in the mid-1990s, the company, then called Legend Computers, began producing easy-to-use PCs geared to first-time users. Sales took off and it became China's market leader in 1997.</p>              <p>A circuit-board manufacturer affiliated with Legend was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1994. Legend placed its PC- manufacturing assets into the publicly traded company three years later, becoming a model for corporate privatization and transparency in China. (It adopted the Lenovo corporate name, which it has used on various PC models since 2001, this year.)</p>              <p>One of the first state companies to offer employees stock options, Lenovo has nurtured an atmosphere of creativity that makes the company an attractive place for ambitious young Chinese.</p>              <p>At its new corporate campus in northern Beijing, the average age of employees is 26 to 27 years old, says Shen Peng, a member of a product design team for PCs and cellphones. She left a job at General Motors Corp.'s design center in Detroit two years ago to work for Lenovo because, she says, she wanted a new challenge. ""The market develops so rapidly you have to constantly churn out new products,"" she says.</p>              <p>Lenovo has little reputation for innovation, though, and chiefly follows the lead of the PC industry's standard setters: chip maker Intel Corp. and software kingpin Microsoft Corp. In recent months, Lenovo began selling lower-price PCs that use chips from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. in less-affluent areas of rural China.</p>              <p>The company's cost structure is also higher than at some competitors, notably Dell, which produces PCs for China and Japan in the coastal Chinese city of Xiamen. Lenovo reported 22.7 days of inventory in its latest quarter, while Dell's China operation had an inventory level comparable to its global level of just four days, a spokeswoman says. PC makers are under particular pressure to keep inventory low because the cost of components and finished PCs declines rapidly.</p>              <p>In addition, Lenovo's leaders have little international experience. Only about 3% of Lenovo's revenue comes from outside China, chiefly from countries in Southeast Asia. If the company buys</p>              <p>IBM's PC business it could have trouble retaining IBM's customers and employees.</p>              <p>Duane Zitzner, executive vice president of Hewlett-Packard Co.'s personal computer unit, says Lenovo would find it very difficult to integrate IBM's PC business. ""Lenovo has been a made-in-China-for- China player,"" said Mr. Zitzner. ""All of a sudden if they're making products for the U.S. and France, too, there will many new logistics and supply chains to deal with. There're a lot of issues involved in becoming a global player.""</p>              <p>Few Chinese companies have tried to acquire larger, more established Western concerns. In consumer electronics, China's TCL Corp. and France's Thomson SA, maker of Thomson and RCA TVs, this year put their TV manufacturing operations into a joint venture controlled by TCL. Though the venture is just a few months old, the Chinese executives leading it recently said they have encountered more challenges than they expected.</p>              <p>And the computer industry is littered with mergers that failed to deliver on their promise. Asian electronics companies have repeatedly stumbled when they bought U.S. PC makers. In 1997, Taiwan's Acer Group Inc. bought Texas Instruments Inc.'s PC unit. But after failing to win wide U.S. distribution, it refocused on Europe.</p>              <p>In 1995, Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. bought AST Research Inc., once the fifth-largest PC maker world-wide, to pave its entry into the U.S. market. It spent an estimated $377 million on AST and poured hundreds of millions more into the money-losing unit before selling it four years later for a reported $200 million.</p>              <p>NEC Corp., for many years the largest Japanese PC supplier, in 1996 acquired Packard Bell Electronics Inc., which was then prominent in U.S. stores.

"187","2005-07-12","Chevron's Pitch","398915294","Wall Street Journal","A.16","            >                                        >                          <p>An unsolicited 11th hour bid by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation Ltd. (Cnooc) to buy Unocal -- attempting to break up a merger agreement that Unocal signed with Chevron three months ago -- has generated an extraordinary amount of public interest. As the Chevron-Unocal agreement nears an Aug. 10 vote by Unocal shareholders, we think it's important to focus on two critically important issues.</p>              <p>For Unocal shareholders, the most important issue is clear. It is a choice between a definitive merger agreement with Chevron, which can close in the next four weeks, versus an uncertain and highly contingent proposal from Cnooc, which cannot be executed unless and until Unocal shareholders reject the Chevron agreement, or Chevron opts out.</p>              <p>Even if Cnooc were to ultimately enter into a firm agreement with Unocal, it would still face a complex and uncertain government review process, including congressional hearings and inquiries by four state attorneys general that will focus on antitrust, national security, pension, environmental and fair-trade issues. Chevron, by contrast, has already cleared all the necessary regulatory hurdles.</p>              <p>In addition to the certainty and security that we offer to Unocal shareholders, our merger agreement is compelling for a number of other reasons. Chevron's offer of stock and cash presents Unocal shareholders with a competitive price, significant tax advantages and long-term investment value; Unocal's assets are a seamless strategic fit with Chevron's assets in Asia, the Caspian and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico; Chevron has a proven track record of performance and will be able to use its financial and technological resources to realize the full value of Unocal's assets, bringing more energy to U.S. and global markets; and there is a strong cultural affinity between our two companies, which both have deep roots in California's oil patch.</p>              <p>The second critical issue is in the arena of public policy. For the U.S. government, the proposal by Cnooc presents fundamental questions about fair trade that have profound implications for all U.S. businesses. Contrary to claims by Cnooc, the company's offer is simply not a commercial transaction. The company is 70% owned by the Chinese government and is relying on large subsidies in the form of government loans at below-market rates to finance its $18.5 billion offer. A conservative analysis shows that the value of these subsidies is at least $2.6 billion or $10 per Unocal share. These terms are simply not available to commercial companies operating in the open market. If Cnooc were to finance its offer on truly commercial terms available to most non-government owned corporations, as Chevron is, it simply couldn't make a competitive bid.</p>              <p>As one of the U.S.'s largest overseas investors, Chevron enthusiastically supports the principles of free and open trade. But, just as important, we think trade should also be fair, and conducted on a level playing field. Government subsidies, regardless of what country offers them, have no legitimate place in competitive M&amp;A transactions. They distort markets, put commercial enterprises at a disadvantage, and disenfranchise investors in companies that don't benefit from subsidies.</p>              <p>The fact is that the Cnooc bid is precedent-setting and it is entirely appropriate for the U.S. government to carefully consider its implications. We respect that process and believe that it should be allowed to take its full course. In light of the review process, a central question for Unocal shareholders is whether they are comfortable with a bid for their company also being a test case for the broader global trade and investment issues that Cnooc's proposal has raised.</p>              <p>It is a paradox of today's global marketplace that sometimes our partners can also be our competitors. We have strong partnerships with Cnooc on several large energy projects. Chevron predecessors began doing business in China nearly 100 years ago and we continue to have significant business interests in China today. We expect to continue our relationship with China and Chinese enterprises for years to come -- as a strategic partner and an honorable competitor.</p>              <p>In the meantime, we're confident that Unocal shareholders, while appreciating the complexities of these issues, will see clearly through to the bottom line and endorse the strong and certain value presented by the merger agreement with Chevron.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Mr. O'Reilly is chairman and CEO of Chevron.</p>                      "

If they stay high, Chevron Chief Executive David O'Reilly could be remembered for a stroke of genius. If they tumble, Chevron's results could suffer for many years to come because of the high price it paid for Unocal.</p>              <p>Unocal shareholders are expected to approve the deal today, giving Chevron access to oil and gas fields across Asia and North America. Mr. O'Reilly needs the new supplies: Chevron's production has fallen 14% since he took the reins in 2000, according to the energy research firm John S. Herold Inc.</p>              <p>Chevron's decision to swallow Unocal comes amid an increasingly tense debate over whether the world's oil supplies have hit a peak and are about to start running out. If so, that will mean sky-high oil prices and a race for control of companies such as Unocal that own proven reserves.</p>              <p>Some leading oil companies, including No. 1 Exxon Mobil Corp., flatly reject the so-called peak-oil theory. They say there's still plenty of oil out there. They think oil prices, which hit $64 a barrel this week, will retreat over the long run and it doesn't make sense to pay a premium price for companies like Unocal.</p>              <p>Exxon Mobil's outgoing chief executive, Lee Raymond, has dismissed his competitor's deal as ill-timed. ""I can never remember an industry consolidating at high prices,"" he said in an interview earlier this year.</p>              <p>While Mr. O'Reilly hasn't said that oil production is peaking, he believes that oil output won't be able to keep pace with galloping demand as China and India emerge as huge oil consumers. With governments scrambling to secure energy supplies, he foresees oil becoming an increasingly scarce and expensive commodity. Mr. O'Reilly, 58 years old, declined to be interviewed before Chevron completes its Unocal acquisition.</p>              <p>When Unocal became available, Mr. O'Reilly went flat out to snap it up. After Chinese company Cnooc Ltd. lobbed in a higher bid, Chevron helped fan protectionist fears in Congress and sweetened its own bid. Last week, Cnooc withdrew, citing the intensity of the political opposition in the U.S.</p>              <p>Chevron, San Ramon, Calif., posted net income of $13.3 billion in 2004, up 85% from a year earlier, thanks to soaring oil prices. This made it the fifth-most profitable U.S. corporation, trailing only Exxon Mobil, General Electric Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. Since Mr. O'Reilly took over, Chevron's total shareholder returns have been neck-and-neck with Exxon and outpaced big competitors Royal Dutch Shell PLC and BP PLC.</p>              <p>But the strong results mask weakness in Chevron's core business: finding oil and gas. Last year, it pumped the equivalent of 2.5 million barrels of oil out of the ground every day. After factoring in asset sales, new discoveries and revisions to previous estimates, it didn't come close to adding that much in proven reserves. Its ""replacement rate"" was just 18% -- one of the worst showings by a large oil company in recent years. If that continues, Chevron could eventually pump itself out of existence. That is why many in the oil patch see Chevron's acquisition of Unocal as a sign of weakness, not strength.</p>              <p>Poor results in exploration are just one of several problems Mr. O'Reilly has faced since he took over five years ago -- including one of his own making. In 2001, Chevron lent $1.5 billion to Dynegy Inc. to help it buy Enron Corp., right before Enron collapsed. Chevron eventually had to accept $850 million in cash and stock from Dynegy and write off the rest of the loan.</p>              <p>More importantly, Chevron's 2001 merger with Texaco has faced more troubles than most of the other megamergers that reshaped the oil industry around that time. Some of Texaco's oil fields had less oil than expected or faced political hurdles to development.</p>              <p>Even as Chevron's production of oil and gas has slid in the past five years, most major oil companies have raised production, according to John S. Herold, the research firm. Exxon suffered a decline but of only 2%. Chevron says the figures don't include some affiliated production that would moderate its overall decline.</p>              <p>Chevron Vice Chairman Peter Robertson says the company is carrying out a long-term strategy that will result in industry-leading profitability and strong production growth. He says it has warned investors that there would be a period of flat production as it sold off some assets and refocused its capital on several multibillion- dollar projects still in development.</p>              <p>The company has several giant development projects -- dubbed the ""Big Five"" -- nearing completion and expects dramatic improvement in its replacement rate. Mr. Robertson told analysts in December 2004 that the failure to book a large chunk of new reserves during 2004 was ""strictly a function of project timing.""</p>              <p>Chevron notes that in some overseas fields in which it has invested, it is entitled to recover the money it spent developing the field in barrels of oil. As the value of each barrel rises, it gets less oil under such contracts, pushing down production statistics. Chevron also cites asset sales, hurricanes and political unrest in Nigeria for the 6% decline in production last year.</p>              <p>Chevron isn't the only Western oil company scrambling to boost production. The fields that once transformed oil companies into leviathans are petering out. The best remaining opportunities are in the Middle East, West Africa and the former Soviet Union, regions with unstable political situations.</p>              <p>Mr. O'Reilly argues that the industry has entered a new era of high prices. ""The time when we could count on cheap oil and even cheaper natural gas is clearly ending,"" he told industry executives in a February speech that he wrote himself. Some in the oil industry started calling it the ""Brave New World"" speech. Not long afterward, the company started an advertising campaign with a similar message. The new era, Mr. O'Reilly writes in a letter featured in the ads, will be defined by ""more competition for the same resources.""</p>              <p>In early January, Chevron's top executives gathered to hear a presentation from Matthew Simmons, a Houston investment banker and author of a book arguing that Saudi Arabia's oil output, vital to global production, will soon head into ""irreversible decline."" At the end, Mr. O'Reilly praised the presentation, calling it most interesting.</p>              <p>Even if Mr. O'Reilly's forecast of a grim future is accurate, it remains to be seen whether Chevron has the operational adroitness to exploit the resources it expects to be so valuable.</p>              <p>Months after closing the $38 billion Texaco deal, Chevron took a $1 billion charge to write down the value of a Texaco oil field in California. Before the merger, Texaco projected that a field off the coast of Nigeria called Agbami would begin flowing in 2003 and turn into a gusher. Now Chevron has pushed back the start date to 2008. It says the date is firm, but tensions remain with the Nigerian government over tax bills and the use of local companies as contractors. A project to increase output from the giant Tengiz field in Kazakhstan, another ""Big Five"" project, has been pushed back a year from its original completion date.</p>              <p>To turn around its lackluster production trend, Chevron spent much of 2003 pursuing a deal to buy a stake in Russia's OAO Yukos. But Yukos's maverick chairman, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, ran afoul of the Kremlin. In October 2003, he was arrested by Russian authorities and charged with failure to pay billions in back taxes. Yukos was later pulled apart and sold to state-controlled companies.</p>              <p>Chevron wasn't the only company surprised by this turn of events. Exxon also had been negotiating to buy a stake in Yukos. But while Exxon turned to gas-rich Qatar for new reserves, Chevron didn't have a way to prevent its reserves from slipping.</p>              <p>In January, Mr. O'Reilly shared some good news with his board: He believed Unocal was open to an acquisition. ""There was not a lot of whooping and hollering, but there was a lot of quiet satisfaction,"" recalls J. Bennett Johnston, a former U.S. senator who retired from the Chevron board this year. The board quickly gave approval for Mr. O'Reilly to pursue Unocal, which is based in El Segundo, Calif.</p>              <p>Unocal is much smaller than Chevron. A pure exploration and production company, Unocal has operations in nine countries. By comparison, Chevron operates gas stations, drilling rigs, chemical plants and refineries in 180 countries. Unocal has several projects -- Gulf of Mexico production platforms and a minority ownership in a Caspian Sea venture -- that are about to ramp up production.</p>              <p>Sensing a strategic opportunity, Mr. O'Reilly pushed ahead with merger talks and made an all-stock $15.8 billion offer for Unocal in late February. Unocal said it wasn't enough and went to Cnooc and its other suitor -- Italy's Eni SpA -- seeking bids. Cnooc offered $17 billion in cash. Eni, willing to offer only $16 billion, backed out. Chevron increased its stock bid to $16.5 billion -- as high as the board had authorized Mr. O'Reilly to go. ""He put it all on the table,"" says Mr. Johnston, the former board member.</p>              <p>Hours before Cnooc's final bid was due, the Chinese company told Unocal it wasn't going to bid. Chevron signed the merger papers at 4:30 a.m. on April 4. Chevron's stock took a hit because investors feared it was overpaying. Then the deal got more expensive. In late June, Cnooc made an $18.5 billion counter bid. On July 19, as the Unocal board flirted with Cnooc, Chevron sweetened its bid to $17.7 billion, of which 60% is in stock and 40% in cash.</p>              <p>Most analysts say that Unocal's assets fit nicely with Chevron's portfolio. Both companies own assets in similar regions, making it easier to cut duplicate costs. And the deal will turn Chevron into the top international oil company in fast-growing Southeast Asia.</p>              <p>Chevron is paying about $10.30 per barrel of proven reserves at Unocal. Last year, the cost of finding and developing a barrel of oil rose to $9.16 a barrel for big international oil companies, according to the investment firm A.G. Edwards, up from $7.40 in 2003. Since some of Unocal's reserves still require more investment before they can be extracted, that suggests Chevron's $10.30-per-barrel price is above the going rate. However, others have paid even more: Kerr-McGee Corp. this week announced a $3.5 billion deal to sell oil fields in the North Sea to European buyers. That amounted to $13.42 per barrel, although North Sea oil fields carry a premium because they are close to the European market.</p>              <p>Factoring in production costs and the time it will take to get Unocal's reserves out of the ground, some analysts believe oil prices would have to stay at around $40 or so for Chevron to receive a decent return on its investment. Chevron believes it could do well on the deal even if prices fall into the $20-$30 range.</p>              <p>""If prices turn out to be where they are today for a long time, we'll have a great win,"" says Mr. Robertson, Chevron's vice chairman, in an interview.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>                             Pumping Race<br/> <br/>  Chevron's ranking versus its competitors<br/> <br/>  Production<br/> <br/>  In millions of barrels of oil equivalent a day<br/> <br/>  COMPANY               2000     2004<br/> <br/>  Exxon Mobil            4.5      4.4<br/>  BP                     3.2      4.0<br/>  Royal Dutch Shell      3.6      3.7<br/>  Total SA               2.1      2.5<br/>  Chevron                2.7      2.4<br/> <br/>  Reserves<br/> <br/>  In billions of barrels of oil equivalent<br/> <br/>  COMPANY               2000     2004<br/> <br/>  Exxon Mobil          21.48    21.71<br/>  BP                   14.96    18.02<br/>  Royal Dutch Shell    14.22    12.26<br/>  Chevron              11.49    11.25<br/>  Total SA             10.41    10.80<br/> <br/>  Source: John S.

But these deeper ties also are boosting the odds of a financial disturbance as trade tensions between the two economic powers rise.</p>              <p>With some members of Congress now threatening tariffs on Chinese goods unless Beijing agrees to a currency revaluation, investors and economists are warning that either action threatens to upend this intricate economic and financial relationship, and could disrupt the U.S. economy and stock market, as well as global financial markets.</p>              <p>""The people who casually advocate Chinese revaluation don't understand how fragile this world is,"" says Andy Xie, Morgan Stanley's chief economist for Asia-Pacific.</p>              <p>To boost exports, China has kept its currency pegged to the dollar at what most analysts consider an artificially low rate. It then takes the proceeds of those sales and invests the money back in the U.S., mostly in Treasury bonds but also in American-made goods. That arrangement has helped to keep U.S. interest rates lower and to fuel the borrowing binge and housing boom in the U.S.</p>              <p>In other words, ""China subsidizes the rest of the world by buying dear and selling cheap,"" Weijian Shan, a partner of Newbridge Capital in Hong Kong, said in a recent note.</p>              <p>The $18.5 billion bid that China's Cnooc Ltd., the oil giant that is 70% owned by the state, made for Unocal is subject to U.S. government approval. Yet the vast majority of corporate capital in the U.S.-China relationship still flows east. American companies invest tens of billions of dollars in China, and any backlash from the U.S. would likely hit their earnings.</p>              <p>Morgan Stanley's Mr. Xie estimates that the 27.5% tariff being considered by the U.S. Senate-which enjoys strong support in the chamber -- would reduce the profits of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 companies by more than $50 billion, or as much as 8% of their total earnings. This could pressure the stock market.</p>              <p>""China has enabled American companies to cut cost and increase profits,"" Mr. Xie explains. ""Only China has enabled Wal-Mart to produce fans at $2 and sell them in the U.S. for $40.""</p>              <p>Yianos Kontopoulos, chief global foreign-exchange strategist for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., adds that much of the increase in trade flows between China and the U.S. ""is little more than U.S.-owned companies shipping back their production to the home market.""</p>              <p>If, for example, Dell Inc. sells a computer in the U.S. that was assembled in China, it will show up as contributing to the U.S. deficit with China. But does the deficit matter all that much if most of the profits go to Dell itself, and to Microsoft Corp. for the operating system and to Intel for the chip powering it? ""The Chinese share in the value chain in the trade flows is quite low,"" Mr. Xie says.</p>              <p>Economists don't see much relief from a yuan revaluation, either. A modest revaluation of 3% to 5% would have a negligible effect on the ballooning U.S. trade deficit with China because Chinese wages are a fraction of those in the U.S., so goods made in China would remain much less expensive. A larger revaluation might address the trade deficit, but it also would spark inflation as the price of cheap, imported goods rises.</p>              <p>""Revaluation would end the Chinese fire sale,"" Phillip L. Swagel, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote in policy paper last week. ""Americans will pay more for everything from shoes to electronics.""</p>              <p>Moreover, with China taking in fewer dollars after a revaluation, Beijing's demand for U.S. Treasury debt would likely diminish, forcing the U.S. to offer higher interest rates to attract new buyers. ""A stronger yuan will mean not just steeper cost of financing of government debt but also higher payments for U.S. homeowners,"" Mr. Swagel wrote.</p>              <p>For John Taylor, chief investment officer at FX Concepts, a New York-based currency-management firm with $12 billion in assets, rising interest rates and inflation would represent the more benign outcome. He thinks any revaluation will only attract more ""hot money"" into China because speculators will view the initial move as the first in a series of revaluations and will try to pressure the government to move faster.</p>              <p>Other economists note that China has accounted for one-third of all global growth in recent years, boosting other Asian economies. If that growth slows as a result of rising trade tensions, Japan's fragile recovery will be jeopardized. Taiwan and South Korea also would be hurt.</p>              <p>Of course, there is some merit in concerns about China's powerful export thrust and the ability of other nations to absorb its prodigious output. China's trade with the rest of the world has swelled to an estimated $1.5 trillion this year from $281 billion in 1995. Its share of trade in its overall economic activity is twice that of the U.S. or Japan.</p>              <p>And if trade tensions escalate, other economies might benefit. A trade war with China could lead U.S. companies to other low-cost centers in the region -- leaving the trade balance still in the red, of course. For example, Mr. Kontopoulos suggests that if China does revalue, the Mexican peso may face upward pressure and be the beneficiary of inflows of direct foreign investment.</p>                      "

Hu and Bush will take place five weeks after China's Cnooc Ltd. halted its efforts to buy U.S. oil company Unocal Corp. for $18.5 billon. American lawmakers raised an outcry about a Chinese company potentially buying U.S. energy assets. While Cnooc's offer for Unocal topped that of Chevron Corp. of the U.S., the Chinese company withdrew it because of the stiff U.S. resistance, leaving the way open for the American bidder to win.</p>              <p>Chinese officials have high hopes for Mr. Hu's trip, his first state visit to the U.S. since taking office in March 2003. They say relations between the two countries remain good, though they acknowledge that tensions have been rising during the past year over issues including America's widening trade deficit with China, Beijing's rising demand for natural resources such as oil, and concern about increased Chinese military spending.</p>              <p>Mr. Hu is expected to meet members of Congress and see factories in a trip that the Chinese government hopes will allow him to meet ""regular people"" as well as politicians. The Chinese leader is expected to give a speech at Yale University.</p>              <p>Among the messages Chinese officials hope Mr. Hu will convey is how open China has been to U.S. investment. The senior Chinese official, in his remarks yesterday about the trip, said more than 50,000 American enterprises have invested in China, ""and we welcome their business."" He estimated American investment in China at about $50 billion.</p>              <p>During the trip, Mr. Hu also is expected to highlight moves by China to increase its imports from the U.S., ranging from Boeing Corp. planes to soybeans.</p>              <p>Chinese officials say bilateral relations have been improving during the past two months. China recently moved to allow the yuan, formerly pegged at 8.28 to the dollar, to rise about 2% and introduced a reference to a basket of currencies. U.S. critics had been pressuring China to make an adjustment to its currency, which they argue makes Chinese exports to the U.S. unfairly inexpensive. Many argued that China's move didn't go far enough.</p>              <p>Mr. Hu doesn't intend to discuss China's currency during the meeting with Mr. Bush, according to the senior official, who called it an internal matter. However, he said Beijing will continue on ""this road to reform"" of its currency, though he declined to be specific about any possible further adjustments.</p>                      "
"191","2005-03-03","Chevron, With Eye on Reserves, Considers Bid for Unocal","398925176","Wall Street Journal","C.1","            >                                        >                          <p>INTEREST IN UNOCAL Corp., the ninth-largest U.S.-based oil and natural-gas producer, is heating up.</p>              <p>ChevronTexaco Corp. -- the second-largest U.S. oil company, after Exxon Mobil Corp. -- is considering a bid for its smaller competitor, according to people familiar with the matter. This comes after China National Offshore Oil Corp., a large state-owned company, expressed interest in Unocal early this year.</p>              <p>It isn't known whether ChevronTexaco will make a formal bid, and its consideration of Unocal is considered to be in its early stages. But Wall Street is buzzing about the possibility that Unocal -- for years labeled a takeover target -- might finally move off the block.</p>              <p>ChevronTexaco's thinking on price isn't clear. Unocal's market value at the close of regular trading yesterday was $14 billion, which would make a deal, should one happen, one of the most significant energy- sector deals in about five years. Neither ChevronTexaco nor Unocal would comment on the matter.</p>              <p>Other U.S. oil companies are also believed to have intensified their interest in a bid for Unocal after news of Cnooc's interest surfaced. The last round of consolidation was kicked off during the late 1990s when low oil prices forced companies to seek tie-ups in an attempt to slash overhead and boost production. Within a several-year span, Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. merged, BP PLC bought Amoco Corp., and Chevron Corp. and Texaco Inc. coupled up.</p>              <p>These ""super"" major oil companies are now facing intense pressure to keep their reserve figures -- an important tally of future production -- from slipping. As it becomes more difficult to develop reserves, growth through mergers looks better. The result is that some of the majors are thinking about gobbling up smaller, although still quite large, companies. In addition to Unocal, Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Devon Energy Corp. are considered possible targets.</p>              <p>Royal Dutch/Shell Group, struggling to right itself after it slashed its reserve accounting, is considered to be seeking a deal and may be interested in Unocal. Other large companies, such as ConocoPhillips, France's Total SA, and Italy's Eni SpA also are thought to be seeking acquisitions.</p>              <p>Making a big acquisition now is fraught with peril. High oil and gas prices have driven up the entire sector's value -- and buying assets at too high a price, especially if crude-oil prices fall from their current heights, could quickly sink the economics of a deal. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Unocal's shares rose 59 cents to $53.50, near their 52-week high of $55.26. The company's shares have risen 30% since news of Cnooc's interest surfaced. During that same period, the Dow Jones U.S. Oil &amp; Gas stocks index is up 25%.</p>              <p>Despite the risk that a buyer may overpay, Unocal is attractive because it has a portfolio of assets -- discovered but undeveloped oil and natural-gas fields -- that other big oil companies covet. In addition, the major oil companies may want to do deals in order to compete more effectively against globally ambitious Chinese and Indian oil companies.</p>              <p>ChevronTexaco and its peers are practically minting cash right now, thanks to high oil and gas prices. ChevronTexaco recently reported a record $13.3 billion profit in 2004. Last year, it increased its dividend and spent $2.1 billion to buy back shares. The company is sitting on $9.3 billion in cash, more than double what it had a year ago. In 4 p.m. Big Board composite trading, ChevronTexaco rose 63 cents to $61.57, near its 52-week high of $63.15.</p>              <p>ChevronTexaco's long-term trends are murky, however. Efforts to get a foothold in oil- and gas-rich Russia haven't yielded results. The company didn't sanction a single large-scale project in 2004, which could reduce its reserve-replacement ratio. The San Ramon, Calif., company disappointed investors late last year when it said its 11-year streak of finding more oil and natural gas than it produced each year would end. Vice Chairman Peter Robertson blamed this on ""an unusual confluence of events."" But analysts cast a more skeptical eye and suggested the company's reserve-replacement ratio could be close to zero. The company hasn't disclosed the exact figure yet.</p>              <p>Acquiring Unocal could help ChevronTexaco restock its cupboard of prospects. But the deal would also require ChevronTexaco to take on a host of Unocal's second-tier assets in North America, just as it wraps up a program to sell off similar assets.</p>              <p>Unocal has long been considered valuable mostly because of the oil and natural-gas projects it has in Asia. It is widely regarded as too small to squeeze the margins from these projects that a larger oil company could. Among its best assets are large natural-gas reserves in Indonesia and a minority stake in a giant oil field in Azerbaijan and pipeline that takes the crude to Turkey for export. It also has large holdings in Thailand and the U.S.</p>              <p>""It's like a rare painting for sale at Sotheby's or Christie's. Collections of assets of this quality don't come onto the market very often,"" says Bernard J. Picchi, an analyst for Foresight Research Solutions LLC.</p>              <p>The company is perhaps best known for its former ""76"" branded gasoline stations.</p>              <p>However, the El Segundo, Calif., company has focused exclusively on finding crude oil since 1997.</p>              <p>That was when it sold its refineries and gasoline stations, the part of the oil business that tends to raise the most antitrust concerns.</p>              <p>ChevronTexaco already has sizable exploration and production operations in Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia, making Unocal a good geographic fit.</p>                      "

Morgan Chase. But with oil pushing past $60 a barrel and surging Chinese demand getting the blame; with American manufacturing jobs continuing to migrate to Asia, especially China; and with low-cost Chinese goods flooding the U.S. market and Congress weighing the prospect of sanctions, the timing couldn't have been worse for China -- or better if you're among those hoping to block the bid.</p>              <p>The latter surely do not include Unocal shareholders, who must be reveling in the prospect of a bidding war that will give them at least two bucks a share more than Chevron was offering if the Chinese deal goes through. While I don't mean to oversimplify the enormously complex issue of U.S.-Chinese relations, there's nothing complicated here from a U.S. shareholder's perspective. Though I don't own Unocal shares, as an investor I'd welcome anyone who'd like to bid an above- market price for my shares. After all, why should bond investors get all the benefits of those billions of dollars burning a hole in Chinese pockets?</p>              <p>No one seems to have any problem when China's government-controlled central bank snaps up greenbacks, which may be the reason we have China to thank for 10-year Treasury yields that are now below 4%. Why shouldn't Chinese corporations reward U.S. shareholders, especially when they're willing to bid for oil assets at what might be the top of the market?</p>              <p>The U.S. stock market has historically encouraged the free flow of capital across borders. Last I checked, the British were the largest owners of U.S. assets apart from American themselves. It's not like the Chinese are trying to buy Boeing or another big defense contractor. But even in that highly sensitive sector, the Chinese are beginning to supply major components.</p>              <p>The broader political and economic issues causing so much concern in Washington have little or nothing to do with the Unocal offer, or with other recent deals like IBM's selling its personal-computer business to Lenovo and the Haier bid for appliance maker Maytag. It's true that American jobs are migrating to low-labor-cost countries like China, but it's not like the Chinese started that trend. Maytag was going to have to curtail its U.S. manufacturing operations to stay competitive no matter who owned it. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was absolutely right to warn against anti-Chinese sanctions that are likely to prove futile in the face of global economic development and will only hurt U.S. consumers.</p>              <p>No one would deny that China has a long way to go on the road to truly democratic capitalism. China's authoritarian government, poorly evolved judicial system, lack of property rights and widespread corruption are the main reasons I've been wary about direct investment in Chinese companies. But it seems to me that the more linked the U.S. and Chinese economies become, the more stable U.S.-Chinese relations will be. Things seem far better now than they were 20 or even 10 years ago.</p>              <p>This isn't to say that I think the Chinese company will be getting a particularly good deal if it succeeds in its bid for Unocal. I am a Chevron shareholder, and I was already concerned that it was overbidding for Unocal at $65 a share. I prefer to follow the Exxon Mobil playbook, which is to buy oil and gas assets when prices are depressed, not when they're hitting record highs. We may be living in a world of higher oil prices, but no asset goes straight up forever. I predict that someday there will be another buying opportunity.</p>              <p>As we head into the Fourth of July weekend, it seems worth bearing in mind that the U.S. continues to have enormous advantages as global economic competition heats up. Its political democracy, judicial system, tolerance of diversity, respect for individual rights, system of higher education, medical care and work ethic, while far from perfect, remain the envy of most of the world. Competition lies at the heart of the American economy. We should encourage it rather than fear it, confident that the most likely long-term result, now as in the past, will be a higher standard of living for all.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>James B.

"193","2006-02-13","Companies in Emerging Markets Show Clout in Global Deal Game","398928267","Wall Street Journal","A.1","            >                                        >                          <p>Companies from emerging markets, armed with piles of cash from rising commodity prices and abundant financing, are snapping up targets in Europe and the U.S., a trend that could shift the global economic balance of power in some industries.</p>              <p>In the latest example, shareholders of ports operator Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Co. are scheduled to meet today to vote on a $6.8 billion takeover by Dubai Ports World, a company backed by the government in Dubai, one of the seven emirates in the oil-rich United Arab Emirates.</p>              <p>The deal is expected to be approved, ending a three-month bidding war for P&amp;O, one of Britain's oldest companies, between the Dubai company and one from Singapore. If shareholders sign off, the top three global ports operators will be based outside the U.S. and Europe.</p>              <p>Europe especially has been targeted by buyers from emerging markets recently. Last year, companies from the Middle East, Latin America, Asia and other regions spent more than $42 billion on deals there -- more than twice as much as in 2004.</p>              <p>So far this year, companies from emerging markets have announced deals valued at a total of $9.3 billion in Europe, which tops the total for all of 2003, according to research firm Dealogic.</p>              <p>In the U.S., companies from emerging markets spent more than $14 billion on 96 deals in 2005. That passed the previous record of about $10 billion, set in 2000. Among the better-known purchases here was the $1.25 billion acquisition by China's Lenovo Group Ltd. of the personal-computer division of International Business Machines Corp.</p>              <p>Bankers and executives say the latest wave is being driven by a host of new factors. One is an excess of cash, generated in part from the soaring price of oil and other commodities in recent months. Many buyers are backed by national governments that are looking to invest their newfound riches in other industries that will help diversify their economic base or provide new distribution outlets for their exports.</p>              <p>Economic conditions have changed, too. At the same time that once closed countries like China and India have opened up their economies, hedge funds are controlling ever-wider stakes of public companies in Europe and the U.S., and generally are neutral about who buys their holdings.</p>              <p>Moreover, companies from several emerging-markets economies have grown larger and more powerful than many outsiders had realized, said Peter Tague, head of European mergers and acquisitions at New York investment bank Citigroup Inc. ""These guys have been consolidating their local markets without anyone paying much attention, and now they're aggressive players on the world stage,"" he said.</p>              <p>Last year, for instance, Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris bought a controlling stake in Italian mobile and fixed-line phone operator Wind Telecommunicazioni from Italian utility Enel SpA. The deal, which valued Wind at more than $12 billion, was Mr. Sawiris's first foray into Europe after acquisitions across Asia and the Middle East. Mr. Sawiris received massive loans from European banks and sold a bond to finance the deal, while giving Enel a stake in his Egyptian mobile- phone business Orascom Telecom.</p>              <p>Even companies that haven't benefited from high energy prices have been buoyed by an influx of money into their local stock markets from western investors chasing better returns than they can get at home. Higher stock prices enable companies to more easily raise cash from shareholders and to persuade banks to lend to them at low interest rates.</p>              <p>India's benchmark index climbed around 50% in the past 12 months, for instance, so many Indian companies went shopping. During that period, auto-parts maker Bharat Forge Ltd. bought Imatra Kilsta AB of Sweden, petrochemical company Reliance Industries took control of Trevira GmbH in Germany and consumer-electronics concern the Videocon group snapped up the picture-tube business of France's Thomson SA.</p>              <p>In late December, after Indian technology company Wipro Ltd. purchased one company in Europe and one in the U.S., a senior Wipro executive told Dow Jones Newswires that the technology giant is looking to buy more software services businesses in the U.S., Europe and the Asia-Pacific region with its cash reserves of $718 million.</p>              <p>Just last week, Indian generics-drug maker Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd. said it is bidding against local pharmaceutical rival Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. to acquire Betapharm Arzneimittel GmbH, a German drug maker.</p>              <p>To be sure, some bidders have run into unexpected obstacles, such as China's Cnooc Ltd., which withdrew its $18.5 billion offer for oil- and-gas producer Unocal Corp. last year in the face of stiff U.S. political opposition.</p>              <p>Moreover, the trend isn't entirely new, as some companies from emerging markets began expanding in the West long ago. Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa Group, for instance, not only is the world's biggest ports operator but also owns an oil company in Canada, a mobile-phone company in Europe and extensive property and retail holdings world-wide. Dickson Poon, a Hong Kong entrepreneur, has controlled famous United Kingdom department store Harvey Nichols since 1991. Malaysia's YTL Power, a unit of YTL Corp., purchased British utility Wessex Water for slightly more than GBP 1.2 billion ($2.09 billion) in 2002.</p>              <p>In some ways, the acquisition trend is reminiscent of Japan's drive into the U.S. in the 1980s. Flush from industrial success exporting consumer appliances, electronics and machinery, Japanese buyers snapped up such well-known properties as Pebble Beach golf resort in California and Rockefeller Center in New York. Many of those deals eventually turned sour. The rich prices became too much of a burden once Japan's domestic economy foundered, sending company share prices and values down.</p>              <p>So far at least, companies from developing nations have tended to make purchases in basic industries that they know, rather than seek trophy properties. Cemex SA of Mexico, for instance, bought into the European cement-making business through its $4.1 billion purchase in 2004 of RMC Group PLC of the U.K.</p>              <p>Also in 2004, a consortium of Hong Kong companies led by Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. purchased the north England gas- distribution network National Grid Transco PLC for $2.5 billion. Other purchases by Russia and other Asian nations include shopping centers, energy assets and construction companies.</p>              <p>One exception: Last year, state-backed Dubai International Capital LLC paid $1.6 billion for Tussauds Group Ltd. of the U.K., owner of the famous Madame Tussauds wax museum in London, among other attractions.</p>              <p>For now, bankers said, companies from developing nations are tending to focus on deals with a longer-term view to potential profits. Many don't have the same shareholder pressure to show quarterly profit growth as do publicly held companies in the U.S. and Europe.</p>              <p>""They take a much longer-term view of the returns from the assets they buy,"" said Mark Preston, managing director of investment banking at Deutsche Bank, who advised DP World on its P&amp;O bid. DP World's winning bid for P&amp;O was at a price almost 70% higher than P&amp;O's share price before the bidding war began in November -- a sign of how the newcomers also are providing greater competition and pushing some prices higher.</p>              <p>So far, emerging-markets companies have been more active in Europe than in the U.S., because many European companies, such as P&amp;O, are global businesses but still are considered reasonably affordable. Because the U.S. is itself such a large market, many companies here already are quite large by the time they become multinational companies, limiting the field of potential buyers.</p>              <p>As the deals mount up, some emerging-markets companies are creating business empires designed to rival big Western concerns. Eventually, that could put large parts of key industries in the hands of those companies.</p>              <p>For instance, Indian telecommunications giant Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd., which just a decade ago was part of a state-owned monopoly, has ambitions to create an international business to compete directly against the likes of AT&amp;T Corp. and the U.K.'s Cable &amp; Wireless PLC.</p>              <p>First came the acquisition of Tyco International Ltd.'s massive fiber-optic network, a state-of-the-art, 37,200-mile long fiber loop laid along ocean floors and into dozens of cities world-wide. The network cost more than $3 billion to build, but was bought by VSNL for $130 million in 2004. The company just completed the $240 million purchase of Teleglobe Inc., itself the former Canadian international- calling monopoly, which was valued at more than $7 billion in 2000.</p>              <p>VSNL has said it plans to use the two companies to better serve the surge of voice and data traffic coming in and out of call centers in India. But that is just the start, says Vinod Kumar, president of global converged services at VSNL International. ""The mindset has changed,"" he said. ""Indian companies can't just operate in the domestic arena. We have to compete in markets outside India, too.""</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Eric Bellman in Mumbai contributed to this article.</p>                      "
"194","2006-03-13","Antitrust Spin Cycle","398930327","Wall Street Journal","A.18","            >                                        >                          <p>Antitrust regulators at the Justice Department will soon decide whether to give a green light to a proposed $1.7 billion friendly merger between consumer appliance giants Whirlpool and Maytag.</p>              <p>The decision will tell us whether the Bush Administration's antitrust team is finally taking into account the 21st-century reality that American manufacturers are competing in a global marketplace characterized by falling, not rising, prices. The washer-dryer and dishwasher market hardly fits the profile of a monopoly run by price- gouging robber barons. The trend for decades has been for home appliances to become more affordable, and what were once luxury items are now near-universal fixtures in American homes.</p>              <p>But Maytag's stock price has tumbled in recent weeks as Wall Street has raised the likelihood that the new head of the Antitrust Division, Tom Barnett, will reject the merger and fail his first major test case. If that happens, Whirlpool and Maytag shareholders -- including thousands of pension and retirement funds -- collectively figure to lose at least $400 million in profits from their rights as owners to sell to the highest bidder.</p>              <p>Whirlpool is offering to pay $21 a share for Maytag, or a $5-a-share premium for a firm that lost $82 million last year. That's one reason 98% of Maytag shareholders approved the sale. Blocking this marriage would clearly inflict financial harm on Maytag shareholders and fly in the face of President Bush's commitment to an ""ownership society.""</p>              <p>Also clear is that the main beneficiary of an antitrust injunction would be foreign companies. Whirlpool estimates that the merger would reduce its costs by up to $400 million a year, thus widening its efficiency-lead against up-and-coming rivals from China, Korea and Europe. Qingdao Haier Co., the ambitious Chinese appliance maker, attempted to buy Maytag itself, as have other foreign appliance makers trying to make inroads into the American market. They were outbid by Whirlpool. No doubt, if a classic U.S. brandname like Maytag were acquired by a foreign firm, we would hear shouts of protest about the selling of America.</p>              <p>The antitrust enforcers fear monopoly pricing from a Whirlpool- Maytag marriage. And it's true that combining the two firms would give Whirlpool control of about two-thirds of the current washer and dryer domestic market, and nearly half the dishwasher market. In the very short term that market power may even give Whirlpool a window of opportunity to raise prices.</p>              <p>But market concentration indexes, especially the laughably obsolete Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index, are notoriously backward looking. Maytag in recent years has closed at least two plants and is laying off workers. The two U.S. firms may control the majority of the appliance market today. But the lesson of virtually every consumer-electronics product over the past 25 years is that only by remaining hyper- efficient and continuously chopping costs and prices will Whirlpool retain that leadership. At one time fat and happy Magnavox and RCA controlled a sizable share of the U.S. TV market. Today, there are no domestic TV makers.</p>              <p>If this merger is blocked, it would mark the third major botched antitrust case in recent years. Justice opposed a merger between US Airways and United Airlines, only to see both go bankrupt. It also tried to stop the acquisition of PeopleSoft by software giant Oracle, only to get trounced in court. The American Shareholders Association estimates that the Oracle fiasco reduced merger activity by some $150 billion over the six months that Justice intervened, with shareholders the big losers.</p>              <p>One lesson here is that Mr. Bush can't afford to let merger decisions be dominated by the antitrust lawyers who have a career interest in seeing the world in static market-share terms. To take one example, the lead attorney representing Whirlpool in this case wrote many of the baffling regulations on horizontal mergers at Justice that he is now being paid handsomely to untangle. A useful step would be to require that Treasury or the National Economic Council review all antitrust cases, so that the broad domestic economic consequences can be vetted. The Attorney General could also put a ""shot clock"" on investigations so mergers cannot be stalled for months on end.</p>              <p>Mr. Barnett assured Congress during his confirmation hearings that he appreciates the global scope of modern markets. He also said he understands that strategic horizontal mergers can increase the competitiveness of American industry and thus benefit shareholders and consumers. This will be the first test of his sincerity.</p>                      "

New details disclosed by Unocal about subsidies Cnooc receives from its state-controlled parent may inflame already-strong concern among lawmakers about foreign governments' subsidizing merger-and-acquisition activity in the U.S.</p>              <p>Unocal first agreed to a $16.8 billion offer from Chevron, but Cnooc followed with an $18.5 billion bid in June.</p>              <p>Cnooc was prepared to raise its offer to $19 billion, or $69 a share, if Unocal agreed to two conditions, according to the new filing. One was that Unocal take an active role ""to influence the U.S. Congress"" in favor of the deal. Unocal demurred, citing prohibitions in its existing merger agreement with Chevron. The other was a request that Unocal pay the $500 million break-up fee to Chevron.</p>              <p>Last week, Chevron sweetened its cash-and-stock bid to $17.6 billion after Unocal said the offer needed to be raised or its board likely would recommend the Cnooc deal. Although it still has the lower offer, Chevron has the support of Unocal's board, which believes Cnooc's bid is weighed down by too many regulatory uncertainties, according to the filing.</p>              <p>The details demonstrate how effectively Chevron has used its home- court advantage on Capitol Hill to thwart its Chinese competitor. Since Cnooc made its bid for Unocal last month, a Chevron lobbying effort has helped stir up opposition to the deal in Congress.</p>              <p>Congress has considered a number of pieces of legislation that could delay -- and possibly derail -- Cnooc's ability to close the purchase, making the bid less appealing to Unocal investors. To bolster its case with lawmakers, Chevron officials have contended that Cnooc is receiving financing from the state unavailable to Western oil companies.</p>              <p>Last night, lawmakers working on energy legislation adopted a proposal by Rep. Richard Pombo, (R., Calif.) requiring the Bush administration to make a second study if Unocal accepts a Cnooc bid. The study, to take 120 days, would require a look at the economic, national-security and other aspects of the deal. Once the second study is completed, the Committee for Foreign Investment in the U.S. could complete the first study, which already is authorized under existing law.</p>              <p>Unocal's SEC filing sheds new light on Cnooc's financing arrangements, which have been criticized in Congress. Cnooc would receive two loans from its government-owned parent, China National Offshore Oil Corp. Interest accrual on one $4.5 billion, 30-year-loan loan would be waived if Cnooc's credit rating dropped below ""a certain threshold,"" and that interest ""would not cumulate and would never be payable."" Also, if Cnooc couldn't repay a separate $2.5 billion interest-free loan from its parent within two years as promised, the loan would be extended to 30 years, interest-free.</p>              <p>People close to Cnooc have said the backlash in Congress has been stronger than the company expected, and the likelihood of Cnooc raising its bid depends on whether that opposition cools. Cnooc doesn't have much time to change its mind. A vote by Unocal shareholders to approve the Chevron deal is scheduled for Aug. 10 in Los Angeles. Cnooc spokesman Xiao Zongwei declined to comment.</p>              <p>Unocal has been courted by both companies because it has built a collection of large oil and natural-gas fields, mostly in Asia, that are coveted because they are close to growing energy markets. For Cnooc, buying Unocal would give it control over numerous energy reserves near China and better deep-water drilling technology. Chevron, on the other hand, has struggled recently to find enough new reserves to replace what it is pumping daily. The Unocal deal would allow it to add new oil-and-gas fields and boost short-term production.</p>              <p>On July 14, the Unocal board met and authorized management to contact both Chevron and Cnooc to seek higher bids, according to the new filing. At the time, the board believed that shareholders would reject Chevron's lower bid, and the board leaned toward withdrawing its recommendation of that offer. Unocal Chief Executive Charles Williamson then called Cnooc Chairman Fu Chengyu and told him Unocal would be willing to side with his company if its bid was increased.</p>              <p>On July 17, Unocal and Cnooc advisers completed a tentative merger agreement on the original terms, only to have Chevron come back two days later with an offer that Unocal's board deemed ""superior.""

"196","2005-07-06","Why Is America Worried?","398931863","Wall Street Journal","A.14","            >                                        >                          <p>Two weeks ago, our company, CNOOC Ltd., extended a friendly, all- cash offer to Unocal's board of directors. After being invited to engage in dialogue with Unocal earlier this year, we entered detailed negotiations regarding a possible merger. We have made our offer because Unocal's asset base fits our business extremely well -- 70% of its oil and gas reserves are close to Asian markets where we operate. We are listed on the New York and Hong Kong stock exchanges and have fiduciary obligations to all of our shareholders. We believe this merger will offer our shareholders, which include many leading U.S. institutional investors, tremendous growth opportunities.</p>              <p>The majority of Unocal's Asian reserves are gas. Its proven reserves are mostly committed to long-term contracts in the region, notably for domestic gas markets in Thailand and Bangladesh. Unocal also has very substantial gas resources -- or unbooked reserves -- particularly offshore East Kalimantan, Indonesia, which will be developed for the production of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Although CNOOC will have no direct influence over the marketing of the LNG, since this is conducted by Indonesian state-owned entities, it is expected that the clean-burning LNG will be sold primarily into Asian markets.</p>              <p>We also believe that our two companies can bring even more oil and gas to the U.S. market by building on Unocal's strength in the Gulf of Mexico and other producing areas in the U.S. Last year, CNOOC grew production of oil and gas by over 7%. Over the past three years, we achieved an average reserve replacement ratio of about 213%, one of the best records in the industry.</p>              <p>We have partnered with many leading oil and gas companies in a significant number of projects in China and elsewhere in the world. An example is the memorandum of understanding we have signed with Chevron to participate in the Gorgon LNG project in Australia, which is expected to supply LNG to both China and the U.S. Of course, sometimes we compete with these companies as well -- in this case with Chevron for Unocal. That is because we are both trying to pay the best price, for a good business. I adhere to the belief that the highest price wins. Given that our bid is about 11% -- or $2 billion -- higher than Chevron's stock-and-cash deal as of today, this competition also benefits Unocal's shareholders, in addition to our own. The bottom line is that our all-cash offer puts more dollars in the pockets of shareholders and is not subject to the daily fluctuations and uncertainty of the stock market.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>There has been huge change in China in recent years, as more and more businesses have learned to focus on proper financial management and corporate governance disciplines. CNOOC is recognized for being well ahead of most of them, however. We are a listed company, with half of our eight-member board composed of nonexecutive independent directors. Our parent company has been a leader in the development of the oil and gas industry in China since its formation in 1982. It is investment-grade credit-rated, has net cash on its balance sheet, and is highly profitable.</p>              <p>Furthermore, ours is a business run by professional businesspeople. Most of the team here, including me, have been in the oil and gas industry throughout our careers. We are also very international in our approach. We have been working in joint ventures with other leading oil companies for 20 years. After earning my master's degree at the University of Southern California, I spent 13 years working with international oil companies, many of them U.S. oil companies. When I led Phillips's joint venture with CNOOC in China, we had 200 expatriate employees working alongside 200 Chinese. That was a very positive experience, and I want to share with you my great personal pride at the thought of leading a similar effort to combine the talents of an American company and a Chinese one. I am therefore very pleased that CNOOC and Unocal have begun discussing the merits of our offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement on a consensual transaction in the near future.</p>              <p>We have recently filed with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and look forward to entering discussions with them and answering all their questions as soon as possible. We are prepared to agree necessary modifications to our proposal in order to alleviate any concerns they may have.</p>              <p>When my company's board authorized the offer for Unocal, I knew that the transaction would create great interest -- and even concern. That is why we set out straight away, to address those concerns with upfront commitments surrounding our deal.</p>              <p>The most fundamental point of concern that we face is that American oil and gas should stay in America -- and I promise that we will continue Unocal's sales practice of selling all, or substantially all, U.S. oil and gas in U.S. markets. The American public's anxiety -- that we plan to take fuel back to China -- is based on a misunderstanding. It would not be economically rational to take U.S. oil and gas to China -- not least, as the U.S. is one of the strongest markets in the world. In fact we will increase production in the U.S., particularly from the Gulf of Mexico. That will mean more oil for U.S. consumers, not less. It is worth noting that international oil and gas operators active in China are free to export their share of production anywhere in the world, or sell into the domestic market.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>We also wanted to send a very clear message about jobs, so our second commitment is that CNOOC will seek to retain substantially all Unocal employees, especially those in the U.S. We think Unocal has attractive and efficient operations and a high quality team. Our merger, unlike Chevron's, is not based on rationalization and cost cutting. As a result it will save a great many American jobs.</p>              <p>Finally, we will sell or place into special management arrangements any pipeline, gas storage, terminals and other midstream assets that might raise concerns in the CFIUS process. Unocal has a relatively small portfolio of midstream assets, which include its 22% interest in the Colonial Pipeline and its less than 2% interest in the Trans Alaska Pipeline. While other foreign entities own significantly larger stakes in even more critical U.S. energy infrastructure such as refineries, we believe that, as long as a divestiture or CFIUS- approved management structure for the assets at issue doesn't damage Unocal's business, these assets are not core to the shareholder value we can create with this merger.</p>              <p>At the heart of our commitment is the CFIUS process. We recently filed a notice so that it could begin to review our proposal. In preparing our bid, CNOOC always planned to voluntarily seek CFIUS review. I respect the concerns the process seeks to address and believe that a successful review can help build even stronger trading ties that are so vital to our two countries.</p>              <p>I know that operating a business in the U.S. is a complex undertaking. Only the companies with the best management teams are able to survive and prosper. Thus, CNOOC will make every effort to persuade the members of Unocal's executive and operations management team to join the combined company. Unocal has more than 100 years of experience in the U.S., and the combined company will benefit from that knowledge. We know their people well and respect them as some of the best in the industry. We, too, have a 20-year track record of working with other international businesses, integrating teams from different countries into effective cross-border joint ventures. With the Unocal team alongside us, I am confident we will build a compelling business.</p>              <p>I know that debate about our offer will continue. I am conscious that, in some ways, CNOOC is helping show the American people the face not just of our business, but of the changing nature of corporate China. The best way we can do that is by being open and responsive to people's concerns, and by ensuring that they see the careful, transparent standards of shareholder discipline that we apply to a situation like this.</p>              <p>Our company has grown shareholder value from a market cap of $6 billion when it listed four years ago, to $25 billion today. I will continue to focus on bringing value to CNOOC shareholders and am convinced that the acquisition of Unocal can help us. I will also be focused on providing our better offer for Unocal shareholders, on bringing oil and jobs to the United States, and on our assurances that we will be an open and responsible participant in the process.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Mr. Fu is chairman and CEO of CNOOC Ltd.</p>              <p>(See related letter: Letters to the Editor: Yes, We're Worried . . .

"197","2005-06-27","For U.S., China Is a Replay of Japan; Washington Sees Parallels To '80s Battles With Tokyo, But Oil Changes the Stakes","398932257","Wall Street Journal","A.2","            >                                        >                          <p>The frenzy in Congress stirred by Chinese oil company Cnooc Ltd.'s bid for Unocal Corp. of California harks back to a period of similar hand-wringing over Asian power. That came in the 1980s with Sony Corp.'s purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and, more broadly, Japan's increasing economic presence in the U.S.</p>              <p>There are similarities: an expanding, export-driven Asian giant, racking up a trade surplus with the U.S. and recycling the dollars earned from those sales into U.S. Treasury bills, properties and companies; a strong bureaucracy -- the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in Tokyo then, the Communist Party in Beijing now -- seeming to steer the economic drive abroad; exports apparently lifted by an artificially cheap currency; and rivalry with the U.S. in a strategic sector -- semiconductors for Japan, oil for China.</p>              <p>There are differences as well: economically, diplomatically and politically. Above all, Japan was then, and remains, a U.S. ally. Japan depended on the U.S. for help on defense, with U.S. military bases throughout Japan and an American-written ""peace constitution"" restricting Japan's Self-Defense Force. There were limits on how far economic tensions could ripple. China has no similar ties to, or dependence on, the U.S.</p>              <p>Certainly the backdrop to the two periods is similar. Today, as 20 years ago, the strains come at a time of self-doubt within the U.S. about its economic prowess. In both cases, the American appetite for foreign capital comes from Washington's swelling budget deficit and a high level of household debt.</p>              <p>The biggest parallel is this: The Cnooc offer generates anxiety in Washington in part because it follows months of economic tensions. A surge of Chinese textile exports had led the Commerce Department to impose import quotas. The Treasury Department has been locked in months of negotiations pushing Chinese counterparts to boost the value of the yuan.</p>              <p>In a similar pattern, Sony's 1989 purchase of Columbia Pictures followed years of trans-Pacific economic arguments. Tokyo already had been arm-twisted to impose ""voluntary"" limits on auto exports and, through the Plaza Accord in 1985, to guide a sharp increase in the value of the yen.</p>              <p>American anger in the 1980s and early 1990s over Japanese purchases in the U.S. was heightened by the fact that few, if any, U.S. companies could do the same in Japan. Japan in the 1980s was mostly hostile turf for expansion-minded American companies -- expensive and xenophobic, the legacy of a post-World War II strategy built around keeping foreigners out and developing domestic industry champions. A few big U.S. companies, such as International Business Machines Corp. and Boeing Co., had significant Japanese ventures, but most didn't. Even though Ford Motor Co. had a stake in Japan's Mazda Motor Corp., Detroit's Big Three auto makers struggled to open so much as a car dealership. After the wave of Japanese investment in the U.S., raider T. Boone Pickens attempted -- and failed in -- a hostile takeover of Koito Manufacturing Ltd., a Toyota Motor Corp. affiliate, in 1989.</p>              <p>While U.S. executives often had little stake in keeping tension with Japan in check, today the huge flow of investment to China from the rest of the world, including the U.S. -- running at about $89 billion a year -- is a form of diplomacy that keeps the two nations in a sometimes uneasy commercial embrace. That is because ""China had a totally different development model than Japan had,"" one based on actively encouraging foreign capital, says David Hale, head of Chicago consultants Hale Advisors. (The $89 billion includes about $34 billion into Hong Kong.)</p>              <p>As a result, there are fault lines today in the U.S. coalition of big and small business and organized labor that pushed for a harder line against Japan in the 1980s. The AFL-CIO talks of tougher curbs against China, as it did against Japan 20 years ago. But while Detroit's Big Three auto makers took the lead in attacking Japan, they are largely silent about China. General Motors Corp., Ford and DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler Group are invested in building cars in China and want access to inexpensive Chinese parts and engineers.</p>              <p>The Cnooc bid isn't just about foreign investment in the U.S. It is about oil. That underscores another difference in U.S. relations with the two countries. Japan was every bit as obsessed as China with oil, importing 99% of what it needed in the 1980s. But Japan was never as aggressive as China in securing its own resources.</p>              <p>Tokyo did carve out a modest oil diplomacy in the 1970s and 1980s, curbing trade with Israel, for example, to ease tensions with Arab states and stepping up trading with smaller suppliers in the Persian Gulf to gain more leverage. By and large, it followed American diplomacy -- and enjoyed the assurance of U.S. military muscle to keep supply lines open.</p>              <p>China, however, ""is a potential security rival to the U.S., or at least a potential counterpart in conflicts in Asia,"" says Adam Posen, senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. So Beijing ""feels it cannot rely on U.S. relationships to guarantee flow of oil -- quite the opposite,"" he adds. And Chinese oil diplomacy is creating rifts with the U.S. in flashpoints throughout the world, particularly as China seeks closer ties with U.S. foes in Venezuela and Iran.</p>              <p>Japan in the '80s had a much more advanced economy then than China has now and was ""seen as a potential direct competitor to the U.S. China is still very much a developing country,"" Mr. Posen says.</p>              <p>By the 1980s, Japan had dozens of multinational companies that throttled U.S. competitors. China today has nothing to rival such names as Toyota, Nissan Motor Co., Honda Motor Co. or Sony. Until now, China's most famous brand has been Tsingtao beer.</p>              <p>""China is still a poor country with low per-capita income,"" notes Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard University and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. ""It still has this huge surplus labor pool of at least 150 million unemployed workers in the countryside."" That means China can undercut the U.S. in labor costs for years to come.</p>              <p>Japan's acquisition binge in the U.S. came largely after the Plaza Accord, which led the yen to double in value against the dollar in two years. That meant that every asset in the U.S. -- from skyscrapers to golf courses -- was half-off in yen terms.</p>              <p>China is in the phase before currency revaluation. It isn't likely to let the yuan float freely as the Japanese did with the yen, and any revaluation is likely to be more modest than the yen's after the Plaza Accord. Still, an overseas acquisition spree could follow a yuan strengthening, just as it did the yen appreciation.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Peter Wonacott in Hong Kong, Jathon Sapsford and Sebastian Moffett in Tokyo, Joseph B.

In April, Chevron Corp. -- the second-largest U.S. oil company in terms of market value, behind Exxon Mobil Corp. -- agreed to buy Unocal in a stock-and-cash deal valued at $16.7 billion.</p>              <p>In a pre-emptive move, the congressmen sent a letter to Mr. Bush on Friday seeking a federal review of any bid by Cnooc, the publicly listed arm of state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp., based on national-security concerns. ""The United States increasingly needs to view meeting its energy requirements within the context of our foreign policy, national security and economic security agenda. This is especially the case with China,"" wrote Richard Pombo and Duncan Hunter, Republican congressmen from California.</p>              <p>They urged the president to exercise his authority under a 1988 federal law to begin a thorough review by the Committee on Foreign Investments in the U.S. After the review, Mr. Bush could block the deal, but such a move would be highly unusual.</p>              <p>Even calling for the review could have repercussions for the U.S. relationship with China. Tension between the major trading partners is on the rise after Washington recently reimposed import quotas on some kinds of clothing from China. Members of Congress also are concerned about the U.S. trade deficit with China.</p>              <p>If Cnooc were to make an offer for Unocal, the Chinese company would have to pay a $500 million breakup fee to Chevron. Chevron spokesman Donald Campbell declined to discuss what the company would do if faced with a rival bid for Unocal. ""We are unwavering in our intent to see this transaction through to a successful and quick conclusion,"" he said.</p>                      "

When he had to shelve his first attempt at a listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1999 due to lack of buyer interest, he griped that investors didn't appreciate how conservatively his company, known as Cnooc Ltd., was run compared to, oh, say Unocal.</p>              <p>Mr. Fu got his Hong Kong listing two years later, but what made investors skittish then makes Washington nervous today: that his company, in the final analysis, is an arm of the Chinese state.</p>              <p>Mr. Fu, educated at USC and a former executive of Phillips Petroleum, professes surprise at the political furor greeting his company's Unocal takeover bid. Please. Its previous chairman was plucked away to serve as governor of Hainan province. Its balance sheet is fortified with cheap loans from state banks. Even its Unocal bid -- now likely trumped by Chevron -- was thoroughly canvassed in Beijing before the company's outside directors were allowed to know an offer had been prepared.</p>              <p>His surprise is all the more implausible given that China's oil moguls have hardly been averse to playing on an assumption embraced by both Chinese officials back home and the fuss-raisers in Washington: that ownership of oil confers a strategic national advantage.</p>              <p>Chinese firms have acquired rights to natural gas in Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Australia. They've bought stakes in Canadian oil companies. Husky Oil, owned by Hong Kong billionaire and Beijing favorite Li Ka-shing, is a rumored stalking horse in pursuit of Canadian oilsands. A mainland firm has signed a deal to build a $2 billion pipeline from Alberta to Canada's west coast.</p>              <p>To the geopoliticians of Capitol Hill, it all smacks of a quest to capture energy assets so they can be denied to the U.S. in a future conflict. To anybody with a whit of sense, however, another word leaps to mind for these investments: ""targets."" China only makes itself that much more hostage to the maintenance of peace and a stable global trading system with its reliance on distant energy supplies.</p>              <p>Congress is not crazy to notice Beijing's hand behind the Unocal play, but the conclusions being drawn on Capitol Hill miss the mark by a wide margin, as do polls showing the American public alarmed by the attempted takeover.</p>              <p>Yet no wonder: Americans are told on a daily basis that oil was a reason for 9/11, for the Iraq war, for the London bombings, and for the fact that the world allegedly hates us. When an idea pervades the media consciousness the way the idea of oil does, there's not enough that's merely informative and enlightening to fill the airtime. An instinct of mystification takes over. Virtually all doings related to oil are reported as if sinister designs are operating behind the scenes.</p>              <p>In reality, the motives behind Cnooc's Unocal bid are pretty much as Chairman Fu says: purely ""commercial.""</p>              <p>Government ownership has been more curse than blessing to China's oil companies. Preferential access to drilling opportunities has led to billions being poured down dry holes. Preferential access to the Chinese consumer has meant being subjected to low, mandated gasoline prices. Refineries are run at little or no profit. Energy shortages are rampant. Last month's report that China's imports have actually fallen about 1% since last year suggests even bigger shortages ahead if Beijing resists pressure to raise gasoline prices.</p>              <p>To achieve the growth not being supplied by successful exploration and production at home, Chinese firms are simply doing what Western oil companies have long done. Buying reserves on the open market is a fallback to maintain revenue growth while searching for long-term opportunities. If any ""strategic"" intent is visible, it's only the favoritism the Chinese have shown toward deep-water drilling and the mining of oilsands. Both are areas with long-term relevance to China's development of its own petroleum resources.</p>              <p>Unocal is a world leader in drilling at depths greater than 10,000 feet. Cnooc holds rights to much of China's coastal waters, but so far has restricted itself mostly to shallower efforts. Recently, Beijing fired a shot over the company's bow by granting its domestic rival Sinopec new rights in the South China Sea.</p>              <p>Another conspicuous Chinese interest has been Canadian oilsands. Higher oil prices and improved technology are starting to make developing these resources economically feasible. Massive investment will be required, but Canada took the step two years ago of uprating its proven reserves from four billion barrels to an astonishing 180 billion barrels -- second only to Saudi Arabia's.</p>              <p>This newsflash didn't go unnoticed in Beijing. Jilin province has long been suspected of holding comparable resources, though a team was only dispatched last year to make the first official survey. It's no accident, either, that Beijing hosted a United Nations conference on oilsands in 1998. Even Cnooc, despite its offshore expertise, has signaled an intention not to be left out of any potential oilsands bonanza. It recently bought a 17% stake in Canada's MEG Energy, an expert in oilsands processing.</p>              <p>We can hear the Metternichs now. They decry the flow of ""strategic"" oil technology to China, but this technology has already been flowing for two decades under joint venture and production-sharing agreements. Notice, too, we aren't taking other meaningful steps to keep China poor and weak even though we fear a future showdown over Taiwan. U.S. policy (quite reasonably) instead is to make sure China has incentives to keep any such showdown from getting out of hand.</p>              <p>Besides, given the global nature of the oil market and the volume of oil required to fuel China's growth over the next half century, Americans ought to be nearly as eager as the Chinese to see these resources developed and brought to market.</p>                      "

A Unocal shareholder vote on the matter is less than a month away.</p>              <p>The board may just end up further weighing the fate of the El Segundo, Calif., oil and natural-gas company. But with the looming shareholder vote -- amid a stew of international politics, shareholder demands and volatile energy markets -- the board must soon choose between state-controlled Cnooc and Chevron, of San Ramon, Calif.</p>              <p>The stock market continues to suggest that a bidding war is in the offing. Unocal shares were at $65.91 as of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, down six cents on the day but nearly 9% above Chevron's offer of $60.68 a share. And shareholders continue to say that the best way for Cnooc to win Unocal's allegiances is by sweetening its $67-a-share bid. People close to Cnooc wouldn't discuss whether a sweetened bid was coming, but they did say that the company's board was keeping open all its options.</p>              <p>Short of increasing its bid, Cnooc was hoping to seize the momentum inside the Unocal boardroom. After holding nearly nonstop negotiations since June 22, Cnooc and Unocal are ""within a stone's throw"" of agreeing to a draft merger agreement, according to a person familiar with the negotiations. Crucial to that agreement, say two people familiar with the matter, is a provision for a kind of escrow account in excess of $2 billion for Unocal. Also, an additional $500 million would be paid as a ""breakup fee"" to Unocal in the event that Cnooc breaks its contract, according to one person familiar with the negotiations.</p>              <p>A spokeswoman for Unocal declined to comment.</p>              <p>Unocal and its advisers still remain concerned about Cnooc's ability to close a deal, particularly as the transaction faces hostility from Congress. To help soothe investor worries about Washington interference, Cnooc on July 1 filed notice with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS. Cnooc's hope was that CFIUS would immediately begin its investigation, cutting the time until a final transaction could be closed.</p>              <p>CFIUS hasn't begun its investigation, and won't start until it is clear that Unocal and Cnooc have either struck, or are close to striking, a deal, say people familiar with the matter.</p>              <p>Cnooc is trying to head off CFIUS questions, and in its proposed contract with Unocal it outlines a series of proposed divestitures, according to one of the people familiar with the negotiations. These divestitures should satisfy security concerns of ""any reasonable person,"" this person said.</p>              <p>In advertisements slated to run in Washington-based news outlets today, Cnooc is also expected to take its case directly to lawmakers. In one ad, a baseball umpire implores Capitol Hill to ""[M]ake this a fair call,"" and not to make any judgments about the deal before all the facts are known.</p>                      "

While the permission improves Cnooc's communication with Unocal, Chevron gains from it too. Without granting such a waiver, it would have been seen as trying to obstruct the best outcome for Unocal's shareholders. It also can get a clearer view of the dialogue between Unocal and Cnooc.</p>              <p>Cnooc has sought to pre-empt concerns that its $67-a-share offer could be forestalled by a potential national-security review by the U.S. government. It pledged to sell domestic U.S. assets to head off national-security concerns, and aimed to reassure Americans by promising no layoffs of Unocal workers.</p>              <p>It argued, too, that the bid unveiled Wednesday is no threat to the U.S. since the majority of Unocal's assets are in Asia and already sold to Asian markets. And it aimed to spotlight the attractiveness of its bid, an all-cash offer that is 12% higher than Chevron's April deal to buy Unocal in a $16.5 billion cash-and-stock transaction.</p>              <p>Unocal shares are trading below Cnooc's offering price, closing yesterday at $65.02, up 16 cents, in 4 p.m. trading on the New York Stock Exchange. But they are far above Chevron's bid of $60.54 a share -- a sign that Unocal investors think Chevron must raise its offer to compete.</p>              <p>At Chevron, one of many descendants of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Co., officials underscored what they said was the certainty that their offer can be closed quickly. The San Ramon, Calif.-based company insisted it isn't asking for government intervention to block Cnooc. But Chevron didn't oppose such calls, either.</p>              <p>Indeed, a Chevron spokesman hinted that Cnooc was taking unfair advantage of its links to the Chinese government, since much of its offer for Unocal is backed by no- and low-interest loans from Chinese state banks that account for the majority of Cnooc's financing.</p>              <p>""This is a play by the Chinese government for energy assets through a government-controlled company,"" said Don Campbell, a company spokesman. ""We want a level playing field with all companies. But we've not issued a call for any specific step to be taken by any government agency.""</p>              <p>Chevron has one strong card: The ability to force a vote on its offer for Unocal. Chevron and Unocal agreed on a so-called force the vote provision in their merger agreement, meaning Unocal cannot bring any other deal to a vote of its shareholders. They must then choose whether to go with Chevron or a Cnooc deal that could get delayed. Should Chevron want to change its offer, it can wait until just before the shareholder vote to do so. Meanwhile, the political forces unleashed by Cnooc's bid could delay its offer for Unocal, Chevron argues.</p>              <p>Peter Robertson, Chevron's vice chairman, said the company doesn't plan to up its bid. ""I believe that our offer is competitive where it is,"" he said. ""It's got a high degree of certainty. We're close to completion."" Cnooc's offer, he said, faces high shareholder, regulatory and political hurdles. ""I think maybe some people now are underestimating the amount of time it will take another company to get through that process,"" he said, citing ""uncertainty and the time value of money.""</p>              <p>Caught in the middle is Unocal, of El Segundo, Calif., and its board and chief executive, Charles Williamson, who was traveling in Asia Wednesday when Cnooc CEO Fu Chengyu phoned him with Cnooc's bid. Unocal also was sent an updated version of a 50-page merger agreement that Cnooc had drawn up before abandoning an earlier bid in April, said people familiar with the matter.</p>              <p>The company's 10-member board discussed the Cnooc bid via telephone yesterday in a previously scheduled conference call, said Barry Lane, a spokesman for the company. But directors had only received the Cnooc offer yesterday morning their time. Mr. Lane said the company had no timeline for weighing the competing offer, only that the board will ""move forward on it.""</p>              <p>Now, the board must determine whether Cnooc's higher proposal is superior to Chevron's. It does not need to make a determination immediately, but is under some time pressure because shareholders are expected to vote on the Chevron deal by August.</p>              <p>""It's a very tough decision for the board,"" said one person close to Unocal. ""If it drops the recommendation for Chevron, what happens if the Chinese don't come through?""</p>              <p>A person close to Cnooc said that the company is prepared to enter into a fully binding contract that would become effective immediately after a Chevron deal is turned down.</p>              <p>In some ways, the fight resembles past corporate battles, including the recent fight for MCI Corp., with the two bidders claiming they don't need to amend their existing offers and hiring teams of heavy- hitting Wall Street lawyers and advisers. Cnooc has bankers J.P. Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs and law firm Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell on its side. Chevron's main banker is Lehman Bros., and its law firm is Cravath Swaine &amp; Moore. In Unocal's corner are banker Morgan Stanley and law firm Wachtell Lipton Rosen and Katz.</p>              <p>But a host of political and economic issues, including concerns about China's geopolitical ambitions, promise to make this takeover fight unlike others. A key factor will be oil prices, which continued their recent rise yesterday, touching $60 a barrel before settling up 2.3% to $59.42 a barrel.</p>              <p>In addition, Cnooc faces an especially vexing chicken-or-egg problem: It could ease investor concerns by winning the necessary approvals from the U.S. government, which is granted by a closed-door committee. But Cnooc cannot go to the body -- the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States -- until it has a deal in hand.</p>              <p>That means the fate of this deal could well hinge on a back-channel lobbying campaign from Cnooc and its government sponsors. The company has hired the well-connected law firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld to handle its lobbying in Washington.</p>              <p>Frederick Ruopp, CEO of Chelsea Management Co., a Los Angeles investment firm which holds 54,000 shares of Unocal, said that while Unocal's natural-gas reserves in Asia make ""a good fit for Chevron, they make a terrific fit for Cnooc. . . . It's right on their doorstep.""</p>              <p>Mr. Ruopp said he expected Chevron to try to make a regulatory case for itself, arguing that as a U.S. company it can complete a deal with Unocal more quickly. Mr. Ruopp did not discount regulatory complications. Chevron could raise its bid, he said, ""but I don't think they'll go to $70 right away."" As for which bid he prefers, he said, ""We like the one that comes out higher.""</p>              <p>Another portfolio manager said he considered Cnooc's the superior bid. ""If Chevron wants to own Unocal,"" he said, ""they'll have to improve their offer.""</p>              <p>(See related article: ""Bid for Power: Cnooc's Offer for Unocal Raises Stakes in Conflict Over Sino-U.S. Ties --- Threat, Rival or Vast Market?"" -- WSJ June 24, 2005)</p>                      "

As of late last night, Cnooc hadn't raised its bid, according to people familiar with the matter, although it was still possible it could change its stance.</p>              <p>A person close to Cnooc last night called Chevron's raised bid ""weak"" and said that the company wouldn't ""take the prize at that number"" adding that bidding ""was just getting started.""</p>              <p>Chevron's move, made just prior to a Unocal board meeting held yesterday afternoon in California, is the first development in a month-long standoff that until last night showed no sign of budging. Yesterday afternoon, people in both camps said that the next move was up to the other.</p>              <p>Chevron is hoping to quell investor criticism of its previous deal, which was valued last night at about $60.51 in cash and stock. With Unocal shares trading at $64.99, down 17 cents in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the difference in prices would have proved difficult for the Unocal board to recommend to its shareholder base.</p>              <p>Investors reacted nervously when Chevron signed a Unocal deal in April, sending Chevron's stock down out of concern the energy company was buying at a peak and could be sacrificing financial returns to generate production growth. Still, oil prices have continued to climb since then and market observers are more convinced that prices are likely to stay high.</p>              <p>Industry analysts say that Chevron's bid for Unocal is justified only if oil prices remain at or near their current lofty heights. Adding cash to the bid won't put Chevron in a financial bind. At the end of March, it has nearly $11 billion in cash and the high oil prices were adding cash at a clip of more than $1 billion a quarter.</p>              <p>Oil companies have struggled to find suitable investments for their windfalls -- preferring instead to pay down debt, increase share buyback programs and increase their cash positions. Still, the cash has been adding up so quickly that pressure is mounting on the companies to find ways to deploy it.</p>              <p>Meanwhile, Cnooc's response will say a lot about how the company assesses the political barriers in front of it. Since the company first tried to bust up the existing Chevron deal nearly a month ago, opposition has built up against it in Washington, D.C. On Capitol Hill, Cnooc's bid has become a vehicle for venting about the Chinese approach to free trade, military expansion and energy policy.</p>              <p>Cnooc's board has authorized its management to raise its offer by as much as $2 more a share, which would keep the spread between the Chevron and Cnooc bids roughly the same as it was before last night. A decision not to raise its bid could be viewed as a sign that Cnooc views the political risks as too steep, or that the Unocal board is stacked against it. Unocal's support is critical to Cnooc, because it needs the U.S. company to fight for its deal against a hostile Congress.</p>              <p>Cnooc earlier indicated it could raise its bid to $69 a share if Unocal would publicly advocate a merger with the Chinese company. So far Unocal has hewed closely to its merger agreement with Chevron, and said it couldn't actively support a Cnooc deal while its current agreement is in place. The best it could do, say the people familiar with the matter, would be to issue a written explanation of its new recommendation. Chevron's decision to up its bid underscores the importance it is attaching to acquiring Unocal's production and existing reserves, many of which are in Asia near fast-growing economies that are consuming ever growing quantities of oil and gas.</p>              <p>Chevron, the world's fourth largest publicly traded oil company by reserves, is facing declining production and has struggled to find new oil to replace what it pumps out of the ground. Unocal would offer Chevron a much-needed short-term boost to production and would help restock its cupboard of exploration and development projects.</p>                      "

People familiar with the matter said a final offer still could come undone, and nothing is yet guaranteed.</p>              <p>Whether successful or not, Haier's emergence represents an inevitable push by Chinese manufacturers to get hold of well-known Western brand names. Having clawed into the marketplace with ultralow- cost manufacturing, these companies are acquiring both the sheen and substance of global players, and they increasingly have the financing to fulfill their ambitions.</p>              <p>In 4 p.m. composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Maytag was up seven cents, to $15.23, nearly 9% higher than Ripplewood's $14-a-share bid. That means investors expect a rival bid to materialize, though the official period for competing proposals expired Friday. A Ripplewood spokesman declined to comment.</p>              <p>Any move by Haier would be a politically fraught one. Manufacturing jobs such as the ones at Maytag's Newton, Iowa, headquarters, have for years been moving abroad to Mexico and Asia. There would be an added significance to a Chinese company arriving in the American heartland only to move many or most of those jobs abroad. Maytag has struggled in recent years with foreign competition and its cost structure, its stock having fallen from above $70.</p>              <p>While less well-known here than in China, Haier already has a plant in South Carolina and is China's largest home-appliance maker.</p>              <p>Haier's interest in Maytag would be far more in acquiring distribution and brand than more production facilities in the U.S., according to people familiar with the deal. Indeed, one advantage of a Chinese purchaser is the ease with which it could shift production back to its far less expensive home base. ""Companies whose work involves assembling anything have to shift assembly offshore,"" says one banker whose firm is involved with Maytag. ""Paying workers $40 an hour, you can't compete with workers offshore who are paid $4 a day. This fits the trend.""</p>              <p>Investment bankers tried unsuccessfully to generate interest in Maytag among South Korean titans Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc.

These companies tend to be purely state-owned and have access to the deep pockets of China Development Bank and so are less likely to seek partners such as private-equity players.</p>              <p>Haier America CEO Michael Jemal declined to comment.

But Unocal's position in the Gulf of Mexico -- and its growing mastery of deep-water drilling -- is another valuable prize.</p>              <p>The El Segundo, Calif., oil company's exploration in the deep waters off the Gulf Coast could yield as much as 15 billion barrels of oil in the future, experts say. That would be enough to feed demand in the U.S. for two years.</p>              <p>Unocal is known as an expert at drilling wells as deep as nearly six miles under the crust of the Earth while floating in 10,000 feet of water. That, along with its portfolio of prime deep-water-drilling leases, helps explain why both Cnooc Ltd. and Chevron Corp. are willing to spend billions of dollars for the company. Cnooc has offered to divest itself of U.S. assets if needed to obtain regulatory approval, but the Chinese company clearly wants the deep-water assets and would sell them only if required.</p>              <p>Unocal's board Tuesday accepted an increased bid from Chevron, which raised its offer to about $17 billion in cash and stock -- a move it hopes will put to rest Cnooc's ambitions to acquire Unocal. Cnooc, which is 70%-owned by the Chinese government's China National Offshore Oil Corp., could still counter by raising its all-cash offer, which stands at $18.5 billion. The prospect of China owning Unocal set off alarms in Congress, where members of both chambers have unsuccessfully opposed the deal on fears of China's economic clout. This legislative backlash, encouraged by a Chevron lobbying effort, has created substantial political barriers to Cnooc's bid.</p>              <p>In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Unocal shares were down three cents to $64.96, giving the company a market value of about $17.7 billion.</p>              <p>A winning bid would be a step forward for Cnooc's deep-water ambitions, giving it valuable technology and experience it could spin out to other deep-water prospects around the globe, said Andrew Strachan, an energy analyst for Wood MacKenzie.</p>              <p>The Gulf of Mexico has long been one of the world's most prolific energy-producing regions and a testing ground for cutting-edge drilling and production technologies. Deep-water exploration is a crucial growth area for the oil industry, which is dependent on more complex and risky projects to boost production.</p>              <p>Chevron has struggled recently to find enough new oil and gas to replace what it is pumping each year, even as it generates record profit and adds to its $10.7 billion cash reserve. Unocal would provide numerous opportunities, in the Gulf and elsewhere, for Chevron to add to its reserves and production in coming years.</p>              <p>Chevron's chairman and chief executive, David O'Reilly, has called Unocal's deep-water portfolio one of the ""key drivers"" of Chevron's pursuit of the company. Winning Unocal would help secure the company's strong position in the deep-water Gulf against rivals including Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP PLC, making it the largest holder of acreage there, according to Wood MacKenzie.</p>              <p>Though Chevron declined to discuss its interest in the Unocal Gulf assets further, geologist Dave Meyer, who leads Chevron's exploration efforts in the Gulf, suggested at an industry meeting last year that the old rocks the industry is beginning to explore in the deep waters could be ""the most prolific petroleum system in the Gulf of Mexico.""</p>              <p>Two-thirds of the oil-and-gas reserves discovered globally in 2002 and 2003 were in water 1,200 feet or deeper, according to a joint study by energy consultancies Wood MacKenzie and Fugro Robertson, underscoring the intense competition to lock up acreage and develop technology to tap into these new fields.</p>              <p>But the risks in going after oil in deep water are huge. Oil companies are spending tens of millions of dollars on unproven fields. Unocal's Trident well, which hit oil-soaked rocks 20,000 feet below the seafloor, took 66 days to drill and cost $34 million; other wells can cost considerably more.</p>              <p>Drilling at record depths in the Gulf of Mexico is one of the most promising emerging offshore exploration efforts. In decades of Gulf exploration, 99% of the hydrocarbons have come from rocks that are 24 million years old or younger. Now oil companies are looking for potentially mammoth new crude-oil and natural-gas fields by chewing into untested rocks formed as long as 65 million years ago and so deep that it can take a year to drill the well. In the Gulf, the newest exploration is focusing on a 300-mile-long rock formation known as the lower tertiary.</p>              <p>""To go deeper is a tried-and-true method of finding older oil-and- gas reserves,"" said Steve Bell, president of exploration for BHP Billiton Petroleum, part of Australia's BHP Billiton Ltd., which is teaming up with both Chevron and Unocal on wells in the Gulf.</p>              <p>It has only been in recent years that oil-field engineers have refined the technology needed to peek beneath a giant underground canopy of salt that spreads out across the deep waters of the Gulf. A number of companies, including BP, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Devon Energy Corp. and BHP Billiton, are pursuing this deep vein of oil, but it is Unocal that has made among the most significant finds.</p>              <p>(See related article: ""Overtures for Maytag and Unocal Have Shown to Be Difficult Tests Of Merger-and-Acquisition Skill"" -- WSJ July 21, 2005)</p>                      "

The White House and other parts of the executive branch have the final say over approving the deal, but Congress's provocations make the decision a politically fraught one. The Bush administration has taken a noncommittal stance until a final Unocal-Cnooc agreement triggers a government review of the potential deal's implication for U.S. national interests.</p>              <p>The level of public opposition is notable because the survey shows a majority of Americans comfortable with U.S. companies buying foreign businesses and vice versa. Furthermore, the poll doesn't show the public as strongly hostile toward China across the board, notwithstanding recent controversies over its military posture in Asia and trade imbalance with the U.S. Some 44% say the U.S. government should maintain good trade relations with China. Though 49% of Americans say they regard China as ""an adversary,"" that is down from about 70% in surveys conducted a few years ago.</p>              <p>Taken together, those findings suggest that, at a time of anxiety over high gasoline prices and military conflict in the oil-rich Middle East, Americans see the proposed deal as crossing a line that other economic exchanges don't.</p>              <p>While feelings toward China are changing, ""when it comes to Unocal, it is total thumbs-down,"" says Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who conducts the Journal/NBC survey with Republican counterpart Bill McInturff.</p>              <p>The results come as the board of Cnooc, in which government-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp. holds a 70% stake, met to approve revisions to the offer. The revisions include a promise to pay Unocal a ""break-up fee"" if Cnooc ever breached a contract to buy the El Segundo, Calif., company. The changes also include the creation of an escrow account in excess of $2 billion for Unocal, a person familiar with the matter said.</p>              <p>The new offer doesn't include a higher price, but that still could happen. Cnooc's board has authorized the company's management to raise its bid; the exact ceiling for that revised bid is unclear, but it doesn't exceed $70 a share, a person familiar with the matter said. At $67 a share in cash, Cnooc's current bid is considerably higher than Chevron's cash-and-stock offer of $60.64 a share.

Cnooc might win Unocal's board recommendation with a steeper price, and that would prove a vital boost as it fights for political legitimacy and broad shareholder support. But that could open up Cnooc to further criticism that it is being subsidized by state-controlled banks, and Chevron could sweeten its offer and just as easily seize back the momentum.</p>              <p>For now, Chevron says it sees ""no reason to increase our bid,"" according to Donald Campbell, a spokesman for the San Ramon, Calif., company. A Unocal shareholder vote on the Chevron deal is scheduled for less than a month from now, on Aug. 10.</p>              <p>Yesterday on Capitol Hill, James Woolsey, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, raised doubts about Cnooc's bid, calling the proposed deal a ""takeover attempt of a U.S. company by the most powerful communist dictatorship in the world."" Mr. Woolsey, appearing before the House Armed Services Committee, reinforced concerns among lawmakers that the proposed transaction poses a threat to U.S. national security. ""Oil can be used as a weapon of war,"" Mr. Woolsey said.</p>              <p>The chairman of the committee, California Republican Duncan Hunter, has been a leading critic of the proposed deal and the broader security implications. ""China is building a military that at some point will be formidable,"" he said.</p>              <p>In the Senate, Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) and Montana Sen. Max Baucus, the panel's top-ranking Democrat, yesterday sent a letter to President Bush, saying the Cnooc offer ""raises an important question; namely, whether it is appropriate for state-owned enterprises to subsidize investment transactions to acquire scarce natural resources that are in high demand.""</p>              <p>Yesterday, the chairman of the House Committee on Resources, Rep. Richard W. Pombo (R., Calif.), called for Congress to require the U.S. Department of Energy to conduct a separate evaluation of the Cnooc proposal before the Bush Administration could start any national- security review. Rep. Pombo said the measure should be included as part of the pending energy bill and would explore both technology issues and the government subsidies involved in China's drive to expand its energy supplies.</p>              <p>The Unocal fight comes amid rising concern among lawmakers in both political parties that U.S. businesses and workers are losing to competitors, such as China, that don't respect the rules of fair trade.</p>              <p>The Commerce Department yesterday reported the U.S. trade deficit with China jumped to $15.75 billion in May from $12 billion a year earlier. The imbalance with China -- more than twice as large as the deficit with any other single country -- is fueled in part by surging Chinese textile exports, which the Bush administration has tried to blunt with a series of import controls.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>John J.

"208","2005-04-05","ChevronTexaco to Acquire Unocal; Deal Valued at $16.8 Billion Comes Amid Competition Over Oil and Gas Assets","398946487","Wall Street Journal","A.3","            >                                        >                          <p>ChevronTexaco Corp. agreed to buy Unocal Corp. for a cash-and-stock package valued at $16.8 billion, the largest oil-sector deal since 2001.</p>              <p>The pricey acquisition comes as Western oil companies face heightened competition from Asian state-owned companies for scarce oil-and-gas assets and are locked out of many regions with substantial reserves. It also signals that large companies such as ChevronTexaco are increasingly willing to pay top dollar for existing assets.</p>              <p>ChevronTexaco, the fourth-largest Western oil company by reserves, cinched the deal after a weekend in which an all-cash offer from China National Offshore Oil Corp. abruptly fall through. Italian oil giant Eni SpA also took a hard look at Unocal, of El Segundo, Calif.</p>              <p>Dave O'Reilly, ChevronTexaco's chief executive, said he pursued Unocal because the company offered ""strategic assets at good value that are complementary to our strategy and geographic focus.""</p>              <p>The deal meshes two companies with assets in similar parts of the world. It turns the combined company into the second-largest holder of oil-and-gas reserves in Southeast Asia behind Petrochina Co., and strengthens ChevronTexaco's position in the oil-rich Caspian Sea region.</p>              <p>Some industry analysts were concerned that ChevronTexaco might be paying too much. ""Should oil prices retreat from current levels in the next two to three years, we see the risk of goodwill write-downs,"" wrote Neil Bernstein, an oil analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., in a note.</p>              <p>Indeed, today's high oil prices -- oil futures closed yesterday at $57.01 a barrel after trading above $58 earlier in day -- are a double-edged sword. They mean that companies such as ChevronTexaco have strong balance sheets for acquisitions, but also that they can expect to pay steep prices for companies like Unocal that have desirable oil-and-gas properties. Other companies that are rumored to be potential takeover targets include BG Group PLC and Marathon Oil Corp.</p>              <p>The deal values Unocal at $62.07 a share, a 3.6% discount based on Unocal's closing price of $64.35 on Friday. Widespread anticipation that Unocal would be bought had pushed its share price up 8% last week and up nearly 50% since the beginning of the year. News of the deal sent Unocal stock down $4.75, or 7.4%, to $59.60 as of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Concerns about overpaying sent ChevronTexaco's stock down $2.33, or 3.9%, to $56.98, also on the Big Board.</p>              <p>Some industry analysts say ChevronTexaco was wise to buy the company mostly with its own stock, since it reduces the risk of overpaying in a high-price environment. ChevronTexaco will pay $4.4 billion in cash and the balance in stock for Unocal and will assume $1.6 billion in net debt.</p>              <p>This is the largest oil-sector deal since 2001, when ChevronTexaco itself was created through the merger of Chevron Corp. and Texaco Inc. It comes at a time when big oil companies are struggling to expand production and find enough new oil and natural gas to replace what they are pumping out of the ground every year.</p>              <p>ChevronTexaco, of San Ramon, Calif., was able to replace a mere 18% of the oil and gas it produced in 2004, even as it generated a company record $13.3 billion profit and ended the year with $9.3 billion in cash. ChevronTexaco said the deal would create a combined company with daily production of three million barrels of oil equivalents. The deal also increased ChevronTexaco's reserves by 1.8 billion barrels of oil equivalents, or about 15%.</p>              <p>Mr. O'Reilly said he pursued Unocal because it was a ""unique opportunity"" to acquire oil-and-gas fields in regions where ChevronTexaco was already concentrating on building large portfolios. Unocal has extensive natural-gas holdings in Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar and Bangladesh. ChevronTexaco has a large oil-production facility in Indonesia and substantial natural-gas assets in Australia. Unocal also owns a 10% stake in the Azerbaijan International Operation Co., which is developing a giant oil field and recently opened a pipeline to a port on the Mediterranean Sea. This fits with ChevronTexaco's existing holdings in the Caspian Sea region. Both companies also have significant holdings in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico.</p>              <p>Unocal also has some less-desirable mature assets in the U.S., which ChevronTexaco will likely sell off. ChevronTexaco said it would sell about $2 billion in assets.</p>              <p>Bidding for Unocal took an unusual twist in the past few days. Up until the weekend, China National, known as Cnooc (pronounced see- nook), was said to be the leading bidder. But for reasons that still are unclear, its efforts to purchase Unocal foundered.</p>              <p>Driven by Beijing's fixation's on finding reliable energy supplies, China's oil concerns have been among the world's most aggressive shoppers for oil-and-gas fields. Cnooc's apparent pullback in Unocal may signal that even the Chinese are wary of overpaying, says a senior executive at a Western oil company in Beijing. ""It may signal a newfound commercial maturity,"" said the executive.</p>              <p>Xiao Zongwei, Cnooc's investor-relations manager, declined to discuss the situation.</p>              <p>The deal will require regulatory and Unocal-shareholder approval.</p>              <p>ChevronTexaco was advised by New York investment bank Lehman Bros. and attorneys Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman.

"209","2006-05-15","China's Haier Group Plans Overseas Expansion, Acquisitions","398948289","Wall Street Journal","A.2","            >                                        >                          <p>QINGDAO, China -- Chinese appliance maker Haier Group Co. plans to bolster its overseas manufacturing presence in the next few years -- building a second factory in South Carolina and looking to make acquisitions -- in a push to satisfy demands of consumers abroad.</p>              <p>As companies continue to pour billions of dollars of foreign direct investment into China each year, Haier -- which in 2005 lost out in a bid to buy U.S. appliance maker Maytag Corp. -- is among a smaller, but growing, contingent of Chinese companies that are expanding the footprints of their operations overseas.</p>              <p>""Besides us, few Chinese companies are building factories in the U.S,"" Zhang Ruimin, chief executive of Haier Group, said in an interview Saturday at the company's headquarters in the coastal city of Qingdao.</p>              <p>By 2010, Haier expects to have at least 20 factories overseas, up from 13, he said. The Middle East and South Asia are two regions where Haier plans to add manufacturing capacity, he said. Haier is in talks to buy a refrigerator factory in India, Mr. Zhang said. He declined to offer details, but said he expects the deal to be completed his year.</p>              <p>Haier's situation as an exporter to, and employer in, the U.S. offers another wrinkle in Beijing's trade relationship with Washington. U.S. politicians accuse China of unfairly keeping the yuan's value low to make Chinese exports cheaper in dollar terms. In 2005, the U.S. bought $202 billion more goods from China than it sold to China, leading to a record U.S. trade deficit that has fueled tensions between the two.</p>              <p>Despite Haier's failure to acquire Maytag, Mr. Zhang said it still is considering acquisitions in the home-appliance industry around the world. Mr. Zhang said acquisition opportunities in the U.S. aren't plentiful because industry leaders General Electric Co. and Whirlpool Corp., which eventually acquired Maytag, are large, and few smaller players remain.</p>              <p>""We don't need more production capability,"" Mr. Zhang said. ""What we need more is higher-design level and a bigger sales network,"" he said, without mentioning names of potential acquisition targets. Haier sees the U.S. as a place to design and manufacture high-end products, he said. ""I'm not putting all production in the U.S.,"" Mr. Zhang said.</p>              <p>Haier makes refrigerators at a factory in Camden, S.C., where it employs more than 100 workers. The company recently said it aims to expand in Camden. Mr. Zhang said Haier is planning to build a second factory there, in about 2008, that likely will make central air conditioners. A third factory in the U.S., perhaps for washing machines, might follow, he said. Haier has made inroads into the U.S. appliance market by selling niche products like compact refrigerators, which have been popular with college students, and electric wine cellars.</p>              <p>Yet Mr. Zhang acknowledged that ""it's difficult to make money in the U.S. market."" In the U.S., Haier aims to move toward selling bigger and more mainstream appliances, he said. In China, Haier has been enduring price wars for white goods, or big home appliances such as refrigerators.</p>              <p>The company aims to boost profitability in part by getting rid of products that are identical to those that competitors sell, Mr. Zhang said.</p>              <p>The company's revenue will likely increase more than 5% but less than 10% this year, from 103.9 billion yuan ($12.98 billion) in 2005, he said.</p>              <p>Haier itself is unlisted, though it has listed some assets in Qingdao Haier Co., which trades in Shanghai, and Haier Electronics Group Co., which trades in Hong Kong.</p>              <p>Haier Electronics has said it will become Haier Group's listed white-goods flagship, and Mr. Zhang reiterated that Haier Group plans to inject assets into Haier Electronics to strengthen it.</p>                      "
"210","2005-07-06","Long & Short: Lost in the Fuss About Unocal Bid Is That China Is the Savings Winner","398949725","Wall Street Journal","C.1","            >                                        >                          <p>IF CONGRESS WANTS to become hysterical about China, Cnooc's bid for Unocal hardly is the place to start.</p>              <p>China adds enough to its foreign-exchange reserves to buy a Unocal every month. Brad Setser, senior economist for the boutique firm Roubini Global Economics, estimates that the amount of foreign assets the Chinese accumulate each month by exporting more than they import is valued at around $20 billion, just over the $18.5 billion that Cnooc, which is 70%-owned by the Chinese government, is bidding for Unocal.</p>              <p>Worrying about China taking over one company seems muddle-headed when the country has become the most vital creditor of the debt-laden U.S. But somehow that fact has failed to concentrate the congressional mind. When the Chinese want to buy ""our"" companies, members of Congress are better able to discover reasons to object. ""It's because they're Communists! Well, now they are, when they want to buy our companies. They are OK when they want to buy our debt,"" says Northern Trust economist Paul Kasriel.</p>              <p>The outcry over the Cnooc bid reflects the struggle the U.S. is having with the emergence of China as a major financial player on the global scene. It also shows how difficult it will be for the U.S. to come to grips with the economic choices it has made over the past several years, choices that have led to ballooning deficits and a lack of personal savings.</p>              <p>The Cnooc bid ""strikes people that we really are mortgaging our future, when in reality we are anyway"" already, says Lehman Brothers economist Ethan Harris. ""Either way, we are giving away part of our national wealth. But when they buy a company, the symbolism is more tangible."" In a world in which the U.S. has outsourced savings to China, in Mr. Setser's phrase, the Chinese will take those savings and try to buy attractive assets.</p>              <p>China holds $700 billion to $750 billion in foreign reserves, estimates Mr. Setser, depending on whether one counts China's infusions to state-owned banks. China doesn't break it out, but about two-thirds to four-fifths of that figure is in dollars, he estimates. The country will add at least $250 billion this year to its reserves and probably will do the same next year.</p>              <p>It is only natural that China would want to diversify its dollar holdings. That means it would switch out of owning Treasurys and other debt and into companies, such as Unocal and Maytag, which is the subject of a bid from Chinese appliance maker Qingdao Haier. That can be viewed positively, in economic terms. Foreign direct investment is regarded as less prone than Treasury investment to being pulled away quickly with negative economic repercussions. Says Mr. Kasriel: ""Someone is showing an interest in wanting to hold something other than our debt, seeing some value in American real assets.""</p>              <p>If the Chinese do end up bowing to U.S. pressure and letting the yuan revalue upward, the country's ability to buy U.S. companies will only increase. Because the yuan is undervalued, Cnooc's offer arguably is more generous than a comparable dollar-based offer would be. In a minor sense, that also makes it a winning transaction for the U.S. economy; at least Unocal shareholders probably think so.</p>              <p>Of course, strategic interests sometimes can override economic interests, and the U.S. has the right to exert diplomatic pressure to ensure that China adheres to the rules of the global economy. The level of Chinese reserve accumulation and intervention in the global exchange markets is unprecedented, says Mr. Setser. ""I don't think there's any question that China is challenging the norms that govern international economic relationships,"" he says.</p>              <p>But Unocal doesn't make nuclear-weapons technology. Unocal's main assets are Asian natural-gas fields that already are fueling Asia. And the U.S. would certainly rather that China buy Unocal than invest in, say, Iranian gas fields.</p>              <p>If the U.S. were to block the bid, it could put the two countries' relations on a much more confrontational footing, potentially reducing the amount of cooperation the U.S. can get from China on other trade issues. Some economists argue that China, perhaps bowing to internal political considerations from exporters who profit from a cheap yuan, as well as hard-liners, already has missed plenty of opportunities to revalue. It is far from clear that it is healthy for China to be so dependent on U.S. demand for its goods. Any U.S. diplomat would be more effective in pointing that out if relations aren't further inflamed by the Cnooc flap.</p>              <p>The Unocal bid brings into stark relief just how much the U.S. is partying today. The country has spent future earnings streams -- from, say, Asian energy resources -- already and now must start paying for it. So far, the Chinese have been ""willing to sacrifice so we can enjoy the good life,"" says Mr. Kasriel. ""The challenge comes later when they decide they would like to enjoy the good life. That means we'll be working harder and enjoying it less.""</p>              <p>It's the U.S.'s role as a massive debtor to China that should dominate debate. Not the possible acquisition of a second-tier energy company.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Should the Cnooc bid be blocked? Send comments and questions to longandshort@wsj.com.

The stake could rise to 12.4% if the warrants are fully exercised.</p>              <p>The new investors also will take three of the 12 seats on the Lenovo board. Mary Ma, Lenovo's chief financial officer, said she expects the directors appointed by the investors to play key roles in compensation, strategy and other board committees.</p>              <p>Texas Pacific, which manages assets of more than $13 billion and has been involved in high-profile investments and turnarounds at companies including Continental Airlines Inc., was one of the bidders that lost to Lenovo for the IBM PC business. Jim Coulter, a founding partner at Texas Pacific, said the firm would be closely involved in ""governance and transitional issues"" as Lenovo takes control of the IBM operation, which makes IBM desktop PCs and ThinkPad laptops.</p>              <p>Lenovo is the largest seller of PCs in China, the second-largest PC market after the U.S., but it does little business outside that country. IBM's PC operation is about four times as large as  Lenovo's, but it is dominated by notebook PCs for businesses.</p>              <p>The new investment changes the way Lenovo plans to pay for the IBM PC operation. Originally, Lenovo said it would give IBM, of Armonk, N.Y., shares valued at $600 million and cash of $650 million, which it obtained through bank loans.</p>              <p>Now, Lenovo plans to use $150 million of the money from the private- equity firms to boost its cash payment to $800 million. It intends to issue shares valued at $450 million to IBM, which would then be left with a 13.4% stake in the combined firm. The remaining $200 million from the private-equity firms will be used for working capital, Ms. Ma said.</p>              <p>The IBM-Lenovo deal is expected to close in the current quarter.</p>                      "

The House of Representatives -- at best acting out of rightful indignation against Chinese intellectual property piracy -- sprang to the defense of Chevron's, and possibly Unocal's, management. It attached a proviso to an appropriations bill specifically prohibiting the Treasury department and an inter-agency committee that reviews national security implications of foreign takeovers from using funds to approve Cnooc's acquisition of Unocal.</p>              <p>Reacting to the same controversy, the Senate passed a generic rule that would slow down foreign acquisitions of U.S. firms. The House action addressed only Cnooc's bid for Unocal.</p>              <p>The House vote in favor of this amendment was overwhelming. And it was wrong.</p>              <p>China's government, showing a spectacular misunderstanding of how our politicians respond to public hectoring, retorted that Congress should mind its own business. This shot-across-the-bow approach -- whether it came from China's PR consultants, its high-powered D.C. lobbyists, or some Chinese official off on his own -- only served to ratchet up the growing animosity toward China, inside and outside the Beltway.</p>              <p>The fact that the People's Republic of China has PR consultants and Washington lobbyists points to a bigger picture. This isn't your grandfather's China anymore. China is moving into the capitalist world, trying to shed its former image as a communist nation governed by geriatric followers of Mao, and establish itself as a world power. Its economy, though still about a 10th the size of the U.S. economy, is growing rapidly. Two-way trade with China grew from $50 billion in 1994 to $250 billion a decade later, making China our third leading trade partner. U.S. firms look to China's market to expand sales in telecoms, heavy equipment, aircraft and entertainment. American firms also look to China for help in reducing production costs while maintaining quality.</p>              <p>Yet for all their advances into the modern commercial world, and growing interdependence with the West, China gives us -- and others -- plenty of reason to be suspicious of its behavior. Tensions span Chinese military threats, trade subsidies, and currency manipulation. Although China has temporarily muzzled Gen. Zhu Chenghu (who threatened to use nuclear weapons against us), and has  taken a first step to changing its valuation of the yuan -- both good for U.S. relations -- these tensions persist.</p>              <p>These are not the only problems. Increasingly, friction with the West also comes from China's prodigious capacity for pirating creations from other people -- from music to movies to software to industrial designs. The recent figures compiled by the U.S. Trade Representative's office are staggering. About 90% of the software running on Chinese PCs is pirated; so is 90% of the music on CDs and the movies sold on DVDs. U.S. firms lose an estimated $2.5 billion to $4 billion annually to piracy in China.</p>              <p>China's efforts to restrain piracy look far better on paper than in practice. China does, periodically, make very public arrests of people who manufacture and sell illegally copied software, CDs, and DVDs, confiscating stockpiles of pirated products as a demonstration that the government is prepared to make good on its commitments to follow international rules. These occasional crackdowns seem designed more to appease trade partners than to provide serious enforcement of intellectual property rights. Beyond the lack of consistent enforcement of its law, it isn't even clear if the goods confiscated in these raids end up right back on the street in the hands of a different seller. The best illustration of how bad the problem of piracy in China is, and how complacent the Chinese government has been, is the much-trumpeted new initiative announced late last year by the Chinese government -- to end the use of pirated software on government computers by the end of 2005.</p>              <p>This sort of blatant disrespect for property rights, and for its own obligations under the world trading system, has earned China a rightful share of animosity -- not just from U.S. politicians looking for someone to blame for high oil prices, unfounded job worries, or large imbalances in our international trade and payment figures. International business leaders interested in a sound global economic system have been vociferous in condemning China as well. China needs to show that it can provide meaningful enforcement of laws against piracy, transparent rules for patents, and other practical measures that assure the respect for legal rights, especially intellectual property rights, that its leaders pledged to secure entry to the WTO.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>But China's deficiencies can't excuse U.S. disrespect for legal rights. We object loudly when other nations manipulate their law to protect local favorites. Yet that is just what our Congressmen are doing.</p>              <p>Congress is not the organization best-suited to decide who should control particular businesses. Legal impediments to the market for corporate control, from the 1968 Williams Act on, have almost uniformly made shareholders worse off and entrenched management better off. There's no reason to think that this case is different. As with picking winners in other areas, letting politicians -- pulled and tugged by representatives for competing bidders -- tell shareholders which bids to accept isn't likely to make the market for corporate control work better.</p>              <p>Chevron admits to lobbying Congress to block Cnooc's bid, which is exactly what we should expect -- why not have government eliminate the competition if you can? When the House acted, Cnooc's all-cash bid for Unocal was $2 billion higher than a cash-and-stock Chevron bid. A nervous Chevron has narrowed the gap to a mere $1.5 billion. That's good enough for Unocal's board, which has accepted Chevron's new bid, but it might not be for Unocal shareholders, whose stock is trading above Chevron's offer. And Cnooc may yet raise its bid, trying again to derail Chevron.</p>              <p>Shortly before passing the appropriations rider that would block the Cnooc-Unocal takeover, Congress also passed a Sense of the House resolution calling on the administration to look into the takeover. That was the right action by a body of elected officials concerned with protecting U.S. interests. It signaled congressional concern with a takeover by a Chinese company 70% owned by the Chinese government, reportedly funded by special government-backed low-interest loans. It showed particular interest in our dependence on foreign energy sources, and it asked the president to use the legal mechanism already in place, administrative review of the takeover, to see if it threatened our security or passed muster under the law.</p>              <p>Only hours after voicing their concern, the lawmakers decided to bypass the review process and jump to a conclusion. Making plain their view that the Chinese, who abuse other rights, can't be trusted to play fair with Unocal's oil and gas reserves, our representatives reacted by showing mistrust in our own government processes as well as in our markets. The House amendment demonstrated an utter lack of confidence that a review of the transaction by our government would come to the right conclusion. It would have manipulated agency funding to dictate an outcome in one specific case, taking the decision out of the hands of stockholders and also away from the administrators who evaluate national security issues. It opens the door to further intervention to promote or handicap other bids -- does Congress pass a new rule whenever Cnooc goes after another U.S. company?</p>              <p>While China certainly hasn't been following all the rules of the game, the House action showed that we're also willing to toss the rule of law out the window. By quickly moving to thwart one particular bid, the House provision (though not law) may already have had its intended effect: impeding Cnooc and encouraging Unocal to stick with Chevron.</p>              <p>This rash action got the enthusiastic support of members of Congress who have been especially quick to criticize the Bush administration in other settings for acting unilaterally rather than relying on bilateral talks and international protocols. No teary-eyed invocations of the U.N., the International Criminal Court, the Kyoto Agreement, or the WTO this time.</p>              <p>The House measure gives the Chinese an excuse to paint us as a nation that doesn't practice what it preaches, one that relies on international rules and even its own laws only when it suits its political fancy. Congress would do far better to express its concern and let the established legal process run its course. Push the administration to take complaints against China to the WTO, to press China to repeal its discriminatory rule on software procurement, to insist again that China take more serious and consistent actions against piracy. If we take these steps, rather than tilting the game- board in mid-play, we can concentrate on showing the Chinese why they need to clean up their act and live up to their promise to respect the rule of law.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Mr. Cass, president of Cass &amp; Associates, a legal consultancy in Great Falls, Va., is former vice chairman of the U.S. International Trade Commission and dean emeritus of Boston University School of Law.</p>                      "

In a July 20 letter to Unocal's board, P. Schoenfeld Asset Management LLC, New York -- which said it controls more than one million shares of oil and natural-gas producer Unocal -- said Unocal has a responsibility to its holders to lobby the U.S. government for approval of state-controlled Cnooc's bid. ""It is your duty to maximize value for stockholders,"" the firm said. A call to Unocal, based in El Segundo, Calif., and incorporated in Delaware, wasn't returned. Unocal's board last week said it would recommend holders accept Chevron's offer after it was raised to $17 billion. Analysts have said Cnooc, which offered $18.5 billion, would likely have to raise that and add a financial guarantee to win holders' rejection of Chevron's bid in a vote set for Aug. 10.</p>                      "
"214","2004-12-14","Surging Economy, Stock Market Fuel Recent Revival of Big Mergers","398964736","Wall Street Journal","A.1","            >                                        >                          <p>Amid an improved economy and climbing stock prices, the long-dormant market for big mergers is showing signs of awakening.</p>              <p>So far this month, deals valued at a total of $80 billion have been unveiled around the globe -- compared with $97 billion for all of December last year -- and several potential blockbusters are under consideration. While the number of transactions is roughly in line with that seen in recent years, the dollar value has soared -- in the U.S. that figure is up about 30% in 2004 compared with last year.</p>              <p>Even with several big transactions still in the works, global deals this year already total $1.7 trillion -- up from $1.3 trillion for all of 2003, according to Thomson Financial.</p>              <p>The activity in the U.S. is especially remarkable given the recent weakening of the dollar and moves by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The Fed is widely expected to boost its target on a key short-term interest rate by another quarter-percentage point to 2.25% today, in what would be its fifth consecutive tightening this year. In the past, such moves augured a slowdown in the economy.</p>              <p>Executives, bankers and lawyers cite many reasons for the uptick, from high stock prices and healthier balance sheets that provide ample currency for purchasers to a recent easing of fuel prices that has reassured them about costs next year. Indeed, the rebounding economy is sowing optimism about the future -- a key to sparking a deal surge.</p>              <p>Yesterday, enthusiasm over the wave of deals helped push the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index to its highest level since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a nine-month high.</p>              <p>Even the interest-rate increases are helping drive deals, since buyers want to move while interest rates remain near historic lows and financing is relatively inexpensive.</p>              <p>Strategic needs also are a big factor; technology and telecommunications, for instance, two booming industries from the 1990s that suffered heavy setbacks in the downturn early this decade, have seen several big deals lately among companies seeking new growth. The deals could force further industry consolidation and boost competition.</p>              <p>Yesterday's agreement for Oracle Corp. to acquire PeopleSoft Inc. for $10.3 billion after an 18-month pursuit demonstrates how software companies that are perceived as leaders in their niches are flush with cash and have enjoyed big run-ups in their stock prices, giving them two forms of currency to use in big deals. Since hitting a 52-week low in August, Oracle's stock has risen 50%, boosting its market value to $68.1 billion.</p>              <p>In explaining Oracle's acquisition to investors yesterday, Chief Executive Larry Ellison noted that the company believes both the economy and spending are improving.</p>              <p>In another big technology deal, International Business Machines Corp. agreed last week to sell its personal-computer division to China's Lenovo Group Ltd. for $1.25 billion. Meanwhile, two far bigger transactions are under discussion, one a roughly $22.5 billion merger between health-care company Johnson &amp; Johnson and medical-products maker Guidant Corp., the other an estimated $33 billion deal between telecommunications giants Nextel Communications Inc. and Sprint Corp.</p>              <p>In Europe, mergers are being driven in part by an ongoing wave of corporate restructuring, which began in 2001. Earlier this month, Telecom Italia SpA bid 20 billion euros, or about $26.5 billion, to buy the 44% of its mobile affiliate Telecom Italia Mobile SpA in one such example, a deal that would allow Italy's biggest phone carrier to manage both companies more efficiently.</p>              <p>Several smaller firms, meanwhile, have been snapped up by U.S. purchasers. Earlier this month, Cendant Corp. agreed to acquire ebookers PLC, one of Europe's leading Internet travel sites, for $404 million. Honeywell International Inc., meanwhile, agreed to come in as a so-called white-knight buyer and pay a total $2.4 billion for Novar PLC, a British industrial holding company. And last week Gambro AB of Sweden said it will sell its U.S. dialysis clinics to California-based dialysis treatment provider DaVita Inc. for $3.1 billion.</p>              <p>It helps that the stock market has warmly greeted many of the recent deals, encouraging a self-fulfilling enthusiasm that has other companies considering deals of their own. Though most recent transactions have been aimed at capturing and increasing earnings growth, a riskier proposition than deals that offer clear gains through cost-cutting, the shares of acquirers and potential acquirers generally have remained robust, signaling the market's approval. Often large transactions cause an acquirer's stock to fall, amid concerns of overpaying.</p>              <p>""The environment for risk-taking has changed in the past six months,"" says Jack Levy, co-chairman of mergers at Goldman Sachs. ""Before then, boards [of directors] were fearful the market would not reward deal-making.""</p>              <p>Indeed, U.S. companies are paying a premium of 28% above the share prices of targeted companies to get them to agree to deals, compared with 22% in 2003. That suggests buyers are more willing to open their wallets for the right acquisition -- and that they feel pressure to shell out now before an improving economy sends deal prices even higher. Shares of General Electric Co., for instance, are up 10% since Nov. 1, despite three expensive pending purchases, including a $1.1 billion acquisition of water-treatment company Ionics Inc., for which GE is paying a nearly 50% premium.</p>              <p>At the same time, Mr. Levy and others caution that a return to the frenzied deal-making of the late 1990s is unlikely for the foreseeable future -- and even the pace of blockbuster deals might ease. ""My sense is that executives are feeling better about doing deals,"" he says. ""That said, we are not back to a late '90s M&amp;A market -- make no mistake about it.""</p>              <p>And not all deals have been embraced. Yesterday, shares of 3Com Corp. dropped 36 cents, or 8.1%, to $4.08 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, after the network-equipment maker agreed to buy TippingPoint Technologies for about $430 million, as it beefs up security for offerings such as voice-over Internet Protocol.</p>              <p>Going forward, many larger companies say they will focus on smaller, strategic acquisitions instead of headline grabbers, especially in the technology industry. Yahoo Inc. has acquired 14 businesses over the past two years for example, and recently said its acquisition focus had shifted from larger-scale deals to acquiring smaller companies for talent and technology to support or complement its existing businesses. People who have spoken with Google Inc. expect it too will stick to smaller acquisitions, preferring to build from within.</p>              <p>Cisco Systems Inc., a serial acquirer just a few years ago, has resumed its acquisitiveness, buying 11 companies so far this year, compared with four last year. But none of its deals this year has been valued at more than $200 million, and the company is aiming for small acquisitions. At Cisco's annual analyst conference last week, Chief Executive John Chambers reiterated his distaste for big deals with established companies that are very different than Cisco. Instead, Cisco, the world's largest maker of computer-networking equipment, is aiming at small, technology-focused companies to plug holes in its product line or expertise.</p>              <p>Hewlett-Packard Co., which last did a megadeal in 2002 when it bought Compaq Computer Corp. for $19 billion, has engaged in a series of acquisitions over the past year. But most of the deals the Palo Alto, Calif., company has done have been small purchases of closely held software companies, or regional information technology-services companies.</p>              <p>Similarly, Microsoft Corp. expects to supplement its growth with acquisitions, said John Connors, the company's chief financial officer, in a recent earnings call. It certainly has a potential M&amp;A war chest: Even with its recent dividend and buyback plans, Microsoft has over $50 billion in cash and generates $1 billion each month. Still, many of its acquisitions are expected to be in the $50 million to $500 million range, for companies with software technologies that complement its core business software in areas like security, virus protection, document management and software for making Windows servers work better with other kinds of software.</p>              <p>At the least, the surge in big deals persuades some investors that the U.S. stock market retains value even after two years of reasonably strong profits.</p>              <p>""To the extent that there's a rise in M&amp;A, that suggests there's real value to the market,"" says William Miller, of mutual-fund giant Legg Mason in Baltimore.

But it will take months for the two companies to fully integrate. Lenovo's headquarters, along with top managers, will move to New York from Beijing, but executives say they plan to run the IBM business as a separate division inside Lenovo.</p>              <p>IBM's PC unit, which operated globally, has three times the revenue of Lenovo's legacy operation, which operated almost exclusively in China. The combined company will have annual revenue of about $13 billion and trail only Dell Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co.</p>              <p>The deal, announced in early December, marks a historic turn for the PC industry. IBM is widely credited with creating the corporate market for PCs with its first machine in 1981, but it lost money in the business in recent years. Meanwhile, China surpassed the U.S. last year in PC production as most manufacturers now operate factories in the low-wage country or rely on contractors that do.</p>              <p>Lenovo shareholders initially panned the acquisition, worried that the IBM operations would be a drag on profit. In the first two months after the deal was announced, Lenovo's shares fell 24%. At their close Friday, shares of Lenovo on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange were about 9% below their predeal level.</p>              <p>With the closing of the transaction yesterday, Lenovo Chief Executive Officer Yang Yuanqing became chairman, and Stephen M. Ward, the head of IBM's PC business, became CEO. Lenovo founder and Chairman Liu Chuanzhi became a nonexecutive director.</p>              <p>Lenovo paid IBM $650 million in cash and $600 million in stock, which represented an 18.9% stake in Lenovo at closing. However, IBM's stake in Lenovo likely will soon be reduced because of a planned $350 million investment in Lenovo by three private-equity firms. If Lenovo shareholders agree to sell new preferred shares to the three firms, some of the cash will be paid to IBM in exchange for stock, reducing its holding in Lenovo to 13.4%. Shareholders are to vote on the proposal May 13.</p>                      "

What gives the declarations more impact are its author: Xiang Wenbo, the 44-year-old executive president of heavy-machinery maker Sany Corp., which has roughly $750 million in annual sales.</p>              <p>The target of his ire is Washington-based Carlyle Group, a private- equity fund that in October agreed to pay $375 million for an 85% stake in Xugong Group Construction Machinery Co., a maker of cranes and earth-moving equipment.</p>              <p>The transaction was originally called groundbreaking because few foreign investors have been able to secure control of a Chinese state- owned enterprise. But the deal's closing has been held up in a lengthy government-approval process. In a series of entries on his blog starting June 6, Mr. Xiang has sought to stir up public sentiment against the transaction, calling it an illegal sale of a strategic national asset.</p>              <p>Yesterday, Mr. Xiang's campaign left the online realm. His company, which had distanced itself from his statements, said it is preparing a proposal for ""cooperation"" with Xugong that it will submit to government authorities.</p>              <p>Reached yesterday, Mr. Xiang said he couldn't comment further until Sany makes a formal proposal. He has written on his blog that he is willing to offer $400 million for Xugong. Xugong says its agreement with Carlyle Group is final and doesn't permit it to talk to other potential investors. Carlyle declined to comment.</p>              <p>The effort highlights the uncertainties for foreign investors in China. Mr. Xiang demonstrates the challenges that can be posed by savvy local competitors who are more attuned to public sentiment and can quickly tack to changes in the political winds.</p>              <p>A new policy document, which was published last week but had been finalized in February, calls for special government protection and support for machinery and capital-equipment industries ""that affect economic security and national defense.""</p>              <p>The policy's impact is unclear. The Xugong transaction had been submitted for central-government approval before the new policy was issued. And the document's list of ""key"" equipment sectors focuses on high-end items such as aircraft and power generators. Xugong earlier this week said its products are ""general-use machinery"" that wouldn't be considered strategic.</p>              <p>Mr. Xiang isn't acting solely from selfless motives: When the eastern Chinese city of Xuzhou, which ultimately owns Xugong Group, began sounding out possible outside investors some years ago, he made an approach. Sany, which is smaller than Xugong in terms of annual sales, wasn't successful.</p>              <p>So far, Mr. Xiang's online writings have focused on why Xugong shouldn't be sold to foreigners, rather than explaining why Sany would be a better buyer.</p>              <p>""The perverted worship of the dollar, the way some government officials treat attracting foreign capital as something holy, has caused the destruction of the strategic industries by the U.S. dollar,"" Mr. Xiang wrote in a typical posting.</p>              <p>His blog has attracted tens of thousands of readers and received extensive coverage in the more traditional Chinese media.</p>              <p>Observers say two recent U.S. events helped crystallize a feeling of disillusionment against foreign companies: the flap that stopped Chinese state oil company Cnooc Ltd. from pursuing an acquisition of Unocal Corp., and the security review that blocked some government use of personal computers made by China's Lenovo Group Ltd., now the owner of International Business Machines Corp.'s former PC business.</p>              <p>""This sent a really bad signal to China.

It is also noteworthy that Whirlpool, a latecomer in what had been an extraordinary three-way bidding contest for the struggling Iowa business icon, now appears to have emerged the front-runner.</p>              <p>In a statement, Maytag's board said that the Whirlpool proposal ""may reasonably be expected to lead to a transaction that is financially superior"" to Maytag's pending buyout offer from the group led by New York private-equity firm Ripplewood and that Whirlpool's offer is ""reasonably capable of being completed.""</p>              <p>Under Maytag's merger agreement with the Ripplewood-led group, those findings were needed for Maytag to furnish information to Whirlpool and negotiate with it. A spokesman for Whirlpool said the company would review Maytag's response. A Ripplewood spokesman didn't have a comment. Maytag's agreement with Ripplewood includes a $40 million breakup fee.</p>              <p>Seeking to force its rival to the bargaining table, Whirlpool on Friday raised its takeover offer for Maytag by $1 a share to $18 a share in some mix of cash and stock. And in the normally sedate world of household-appliance manufacturing, Whirlpool gave Maytag only the weekend to respond. Fed up with five days of lukewarm responses from Maytag to its initial offer, Whirlpool decided to play hardball, insisting Friday night that Maytag either negotiate an acquisition by yesterday's deadline or face Whirlpool's walking away from any deal.</p>              <p>Whirlpool, Benton Harbor, Mich., made its first proposal to acquire Maytag, an appliance maker in Newton, Iowa, on July 17. That initial bid was for $17 a share in cash and stock, or about $1.33 billion. While apparently richer than the Ripplewood offer of $14 a share, or $1.13 billion, Ripplewood's offer was for all cash.</p>              <p>Still, failing to close on the sweetened $18-a-share bid could put Maytag at odds with investors and shareholders, some of whom were vocal in their disappointment with a $14-a-share offer. A Maytag shareholder vote on the Ripplewood offer is set for Aug. 19.</p>              <p>In the past week, Maytag has expressed concerns that a merger with Whirlpool wouldn't win regulatory approval. Combining such large players in the North American appliance business is certain to draw close scrutiny from antitrust regulators. Along with its sweetened offer, though, Whirlpool provided Maytag with a poll showing supportive reactions to the proposed combination from large appliance retailers.</p>              <p>Just days after Whirlpool made its initial overture, a third party, a group led by Chinese appliance maker Qingdao Haier Co., withdrew from the bidding.</p>              <p>Maytag's results improved in the second quarter, as the company Friday said it moved to a profit of $3.5 million, or four cents a share, from a loss of $41.1 million, or 52 cents a share, a year earlier. Maytag shares rose 55 cents, or 3.5%, to $16.20 Friday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, while Whirpool shares fell 72 cents to $77.18.</p>                      "

Unocal may be an American company, but its riches are mostly in Asia and already serve the Asian market. Moreover, those riches are mostly in the form of natural gas, not the oil the U.S. craves. Unocal pumps oil from the Gulf of Mexico, but those supplies are a small fraction of U.S. consumption and are unlikely to be disrupted.</p>              <p>There may be some security concerns at the margin, such as Unocal's terminals at the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But these can be dealt with by divestiture. Unocal in the hands of a Chinese company -- even one owned by the Chinese government -- isn't a threat.</p>              <p>But that won't keep the prospect of a Cnooc-Unocal merger from fueling a continuing furor in Washington.</p>              <p>Think of this as an accumulation of volatile gases that were just waiting for a spark. The Cnooc bid provided it.</p>              <p>First, there were skyrocketing textile imports from China, following the lifting of quotas this year. Then there is the continuing theft of the intellectual property of U.S. companies by the Chinese. On top of that, there is the refusal of the Chinese government to respond to repeated entreaties from President Bush and Treasury Secretary John Snow to adjust its currency, which is kept cheap to encourage exports and discourage imports.</p>              <p>Underlying all is a rising uneasiness among Americans that their jobs may be endangered by low-cost labor in China. Members of Congress don't act in a vacuum. They are hearing from constituents, and they are responding.</p>              <p>We've seen this movie before. Twenty years ago, Japan played the lead role. But there's a difference. Japan's companies were merely suspected of working hand-in-glove with the government. China's companies are owned by the government. And that government, by the way, isn't the sort Americans like to deal with.</p>              <p>""Japan was an ally, and Japan was fundamentally a smaller country than we are,"" says New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer. China isn't exactly an ally, and it is very, very big. ""China is emerging as a dominant player, and at the same time, China isn't acting like one,"" Sen. Schumer says. ""It isn't playing by the rules.""</p>              <p>Then there are the national-security concerns -- raised recently by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who openly worried about China's increased purchase of arms. No one thinks the Chinese are about to invade the U.S. But many do fear a conflagration with Taiwan, which the U.S. has said it is prepared to defend.</p>              <p>None of this has much to do with the Unocal bid. U.S. complaints about government backing for Chinese industry ring hollow when the industry in question is oil. The U.S. government has treated American oil companies as a virtual state industry for decades. How else to explain the lavish tax breaks, the push to build a Central Asian pipeline or decades of foreign relations with Saudi Arabia?</p>              <p>Still, the furor in Washington creates enormous uncertainty. And for Unocal, uncertainty argues against a Cnooc deal.</p>              <p>Rep. David Dreier, the California Republican who heads the House of Representatives' Rules Committee -- and is a leading proponent of free trade -- counsels patience among his colleagues. ""I think there are upsides to letting this thing run its course"" in Washington, he says.</p>              <p>But I doubt Unocal's directors see it that way. They already have signed a deal with Chevron and aren't going to be eager to walk away from it -- at a substantial breakup penalty -- to embrace a deal with Cnooc that could get blown apart in Washington.</p>              <p>When MCI urged its shareholders to embrace a merger with Verizon, rather than a higher-priced offer from Qwest, MCI's executives relied heavily on the argument that there were ""closing risks"" -- things that might happen to heavily indebted Qwest before the deal was completed. In this case, the closing risks are far greater. No one can guarantee Unocal that, in the current environment, a Cnooc deal would be approved. As a result, Chevron may have to raise its offer, but it won't have to match Cnooc's pricey bid.</p>              <p>Cnooc Chief Executive Fu Chengyu may win plaudits for his boldness, but he has made a miscalculation. This deal has too much going against it.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Should Unocal merge with Cnooc? Write to me at business@wsj.com.

A report of talks with Hong Kong- listed Lenovo appeared Friday in the New York Times.</p>              <p>Analyst Steven Milunovich of Merrill Lynch, which does investment- banking business for IBM, estimates that the sale could add five cents a share to earnings next year by eliminating losses from the PC business. Mr. Milunovich, who owns no IBM stock, estimates IBM will earn $5.50 a share next year, up from $5 this year.</p>              <p>But because PCs account for so much of IBM's revenue and are losing money, the gains to IBM's profit margins will be greater than the incremental per-share earnings gains. Over the long haul, better margins usually translate into a higher stock price.</p>              <p>Results for PCs aren't reported separately by IBM, but are part of its personal-systems group, which also includes retail point-of-sale systems and specialty printers. Those businesses aren't expected to be part of the sale to Lenovo, a person familiar with the matter says.</p>              <p>Steven Weber, an S.G. Cowen analyst who owns IBM stock, estimated in a Friday report that the laptop and desktop business by itself will generate about $10 billion of IBM's revenue this year and lose $250 million before taxes.</p>              <p>Without those revenues and losses, IBM's pretax profit margins this year would be about 14.4%, considerably better than the 12.7% or so expected in analysts' models. Last year, IBM's total revenue was $89.13 billion, and net income was $7.58 billion.</p>              <p>By getting out of the PC business, ""IBM is continuing its long run toward services and software,"" says Ben Reitzes, an analyst with UBS Securities. Companies in those businesses earn higher price-to- earnings multiples from investors than do those selling commodity-like PCs. ""IBM is looking to enhance shareholder value,"" says Mr. Reitzes, whose firm does investment banking with IBM and whose team members own IBM stock.</p>              <p>A person familiar with the negotiations says that talks with Beijing-based Lenovo haven't been wrapped up, and two other bidders remain interested. However, the talks with Lenovo are far along, and a deal could be announced as soon as tomorrow.</p>              <p>This person says that IBM would retain a minority stake and thus would be in a position to benefit from any gains in the business after the sale, without incurring the costs that often have dragged down its overall results. Lenovo would pay as much as $2 billion, acquire IBM's 2,500-person PC design and development operations in Raleigh, N.C., and be able to sell PCs under the IBM brand, with IBM service contracts, this person says.</p>              <p>In addition to cutting its costs, this person says, IBM expects its relationship to Lenovo, which is the No. 1 PC company in China by unit sales, to improve access to the country's market for its servers, software and computer services.</p>              <p>IBM, of Armonk, N.Y., pioneered the PC that became the industry standard in 1981 and had the leading market share until 1994. But after that, sales slumped and losses mushroomed, hitting $992 million in 1998, and prompting IBM to stop selling to consumers at the retail level. Since then, IBM has managed to reduce its costs by outsourcing manufacturing to Sanmina-SCI Corp., of San Jose, Calif., and has eked out small profits some quarters.</p>              <p>IBM executives have said the PC was important in positioning IBM as a full-service vendor. Its heavily advertised ThinkPad laptops have been the company's most recognizable personal product and gave it cachet among executives who didn't care about servers and databases. ThinkPads are the leading laptop in Asia. In the first nine months of this year, personal systems have been IBM's fastest-growing business, increasing 17% to $9.37 billion in sales and showing a $70 million pretax profit.</p>              <p>Still, Wall Street long has questioned the value of staying in the tough, slowing PC business. IBM is a distant No. 3 PC seller world- wide, according to market researcher Gartner Inc., with its 5.6% share lagging far behind leaders Dell Inc., at 16.8%, and Hewlett-Packard Co., at 15%. Last year, IBM's personal-systems group reported revenue of $11.56 billion and a pretax loss of $118 million.</p>              <p>Analysts say that if IBM does leave the PC business, it risks opening up to competitors some of its loyal customers who might be skeptical about Lenovo as a supplier. Duane Zitzner, executive vice president of Hewlett-Packard's PC unit, says, ""This will create a lot of uncertainty amongst IBM's customers, and it should."" He adds that ""Lenovo has been a made-in-China-for-China player,"" and selling in the U.S. or France would require new logistics and supply chains.</p>              <p>A person familiar with the industry says that IBM representatives several times over the past six years approached other companies, including H-P, about buying the PC business. Price always had been unacceptably high, but IBM recently had indicated willingness to accept a lower price, the person says.</p>              <p>John Jones, president of Triley Ventures LLC, a Ross, Calif., investment and consulting firm, believes either H-P or Dell would be willing to pay more for IBM's business than Lenovo is expected to pay, since the acquisition ""would break the see-saw battle those guys are having"" for the No. 1 position in PC sales world-wide and would provide access to IBM's blue-chip accounts. However, IBM may be reluctant to help companies that are its bitter rivals in other areas, including the more profitable server business. For IBM, he adds, striking a deal with Lenovo ""must be about expanding their opportunities in China,"" the world's fastest-growing computer market.</p>              <p>With the backdrop to a possible sale an expected sharp slowdown in the PC industry next year, Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, notes that, if IBM's PC sales stopped growing and the rest of the company was growing 5%, ""getting out adds half a [percentage point] to IBM's growth rate."" In trying to sell the unit, he says, IBM probably isn't pushing to get the highest price possible because, with IBM generating $2 billion each quarter in free cash flow, ""this is one of those cases where a billion here or there really doesn't matter that much.""</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Pui-Wing Tam and Gary McWilliams contributed to this article.</p>                      "

Typically, it has invested them in Treasury bonds and bills and similar portfolio assets. At the end of April, mainland China held $230 billion in U.S. Treasurys, according to the Treasury Department. The U.S., in turn, must borrow from foreigners to finance its persistent trade deficits, and in effect does this by selling Treasury bonds and other IOUs to foreigners, especially to foreign central banks such as China's.</p>              <p>China has used little of its growing stash of dollar holdings to buy direct control of U.S. enterprises. But if the purchase of Unocal goes through, Chinese direct investment would begin to rival its passive ""portfolio"" investment. It would vault Chinese purchases of U.S. companies this year to $20 billion, according to Thomson Financial. That would easily surpass last year's record, $2.3 billion record, a tally dominated by Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group Ltd.'s purchase of International Business Machines Corp.'s personal-computer division.</p>              <p>In the prior 14 years, Chinese acquisitions never exceeded $2 billion annually, and were dominated by Hong Kong companies such as Tommy Hilfiger Corp. Britain handed control of Hong Kong to China in 1997.</p>              <p>Adam Posen, a scholar at the Institute for International Economics, a think tank, in Washington, said the growth of Chinese direct investment is an inevitable consequence of its economic development. ""When you're at the bottom of the development scale, you are ill- equipped as an investor and manager, in terms of human capital and associated-services infrastructure, to decide upon and monitor investments abroad."" As a country develops, it gains the experience and sophistication to identify and capture the benefits of foreign investment, he says. Moreover, profitable investment opportunities within China are diminishing after years of hectic capital spending, making overseas opportunities more attractive, he said.</p>              <p>Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a think tank in Washington, adds that China's trade surpluses mean it needs to find uses for all its dollars and ""they've already got too many Treasurys. So they're looking to buy assets. Chinese companies are growing, they are ambitious, they want to be global players, they want to have global brands, and in the case of oil they are kind of obsessed with assuring energy security for the long run so they're buying up all the oil and oil rights they can find.""</p>              <p>Still, China remains a bit player as a foreign investor. This would be the first year it has been the leading foreign player in U.S. mergers and acquisitions, according to Thomson Financial. In part, that is because investment by other countries has declined sharply from a peak in 2000. Moreover, other countries, thanks to many more years of U.S. investment activity, are far more important in terms of the total level of existing investment. Switzerland was the largest foreign investor in the U.S. in 2002, the most recent year for which the Commerce Department has detailed data, with $878 billion invested in U.S.-based corporate assets, employing 430,000 people. Japan had $431 billion invested, employing 628,000. China and Hong Kong that year had assets of just $8 billion, employing 15,000 people. The same year, U.S. companies had $105 billion in assets and 391,000 employees in China and Hong Kong.</p>              <p>China's investment is reminiscent of Japan's wave of investment beginning in the 1980s. At that time, Mr. Posen said, many Americans worried Japan had an ""alien business system contrary to our way of life"" and its companies would take American technology and jobs back to Japan, hollowing out American industry. ""None of it was true,"" he said. Some production did move abroad but Japanese companies are now major U.S. employers. ""Technology transfer and reverse engineering isn't as easy as people think it is and that's going to be much more true for the Chinese,"" whose investments are in more low-tech areas.</p>              <p>Mr. Posen said Chinese investment will be more of a political than economic issue. U.S.-Japan economic tensions, he noted, were never allowed to interfere with the critical strategic alliance between the two. But China is more of a strategic rival, which will affect how U.S. politicians regard its investment.</p>              <p>Mr. Prestowitz notes Japan's investment aroused the ire of U.S. business because U.S. business was effectively blocked from buying Japanese companies. ""U.S. chief executive officers are all invested in China, selling in China, want to maintain good relationships with the Chinese government. You just don't have the same political dynamics.""</p>                      "

Chinese TV maker TCL Corp. took control of the manufacturing operations of RCA-brand owner Thomson SA of France. Then computer maker Lenovo Group of China bought the personal-computer operations of International Business Machines Corp. This month, Taiwanese electronics maker BenQ Corp. took over the cellphone operations of Germany's Siemens AG.</p>              <p>Chinese companies are on a buying spree because they sense ""it's now or never,"" says Paul Gao, a partner in Shanghai at McKinsey &amp; Co. ""They have reached a bottleneck in their next stage of development.""</p>              <p>Foreign companies have used several strategies to expand into the U.S. Some purchased U.S. brands: BP PLC of the United Kingdom bought Amoco, slowly phasing in the BP name, and Philips Electronics NV of Amsterdam bought Magnavox. Others have built their U.S. customer base organically. Among these players are Japanese car makers Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co., and electronics makers Sony Corp. of Japan and Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea. But this path can take a long time and hit bumps along the way: Fifteen years ago, Korea's Hyundai Motor Co. was mocked in the U.S. for the shoddy craftsmanship of its cars; now it tops quality surveys and produces some of the most popular autos in the American market.</p>              <p>But Japanese and Korean manufacturers that moved to the U.S. enjoyed a boost their Chinese counterparts lack: a government-protected home market in the 1980s and '90s that allowed them to finance their international push with rich profits from domestic sales. China has largely opened up its consumer market to competition. ""The Chinese companies simply cannot afford to wait until they dominate the domestic market and slowly grow their international presence,"" says McKinsey's Mr. Gao.</p>              <p>Yet wooing brand-conscious Americans shoppers is a slow process that almost no Chinese manufacturers, used to selling on price, have mastered. Almost a decade ago, Konka Group Ltd., then China's biggest TV maker, made a big push into the U.S. and seemed to make progress for a while with a low-cost line of sets. But it never gained the marketing savvy or name recognition it needed and has since retreated to its home market, where it has slipped to No. 3.</p>              <p>Buying an established company, on the other hand, offers Chinese companies immediate access to technology, experienced marketing executives and coveted distribution channels at a time when America's retail industry is consolidating.</p>              <p>But most of all, Haier wants the Maytag brand. Made famous in America through commercials since the 1960s featuring the lovable, lonely Maytag repairman, Maytag's emotional relationship with American consumers drives the company's business today as much as the technology in its appliances. Maytag also owns other well-known U.S. appliance brands, including Amana, Hoover and the upscale Jenn-Air.</p>              <p>Haier would be unlikely to put the Maytag repairman out of work. Madison Avenue executives say Haier would want to preserve Maytag's name and heritage -- that is why it, along with partners Blackstone Group and Bain Capital, is offering a premium over an earlier bid for Maytag from an investment  group led by Ripplewood Holdings LLC.</p>              <p>""Haier's target is Maytag's prestigious brand name as well as its mature sales channels,"" says Pan Chengli, an economist and independent director of Haier's Shanghai-listed subsidiary, Qingdao Haier.</p>              <p>Haier (pronounced HIGH-ER) is a descendent of a government-owned refrigerator factory that now is China's largest appliance manufacturer. It is one of the few Chinese brands, along with Tsingtao beer, that American consumers may recognize. Long a big seller of minifridges in the U.S., the company opened a factory in South Carolina in 1999. Its appliances now account for 2% of all full-size refrigerators sold in the U.S., 16% of window air conditioners and 8% of portable fans. Globally, the company had sales last year of $12.2 billion.</p>              <p>Haier plans to follow Lenovo's branding approach with IBM, Mr. Pan says, though Haier management has declined to comment on its marketing plans. The two computer makers agreed that Lenovo can use the IBM brand on its PCs for five years, though Lenovo is planning to shift to its own name in only 18 months. That means it will have to build up its own brand in a hurry. To do that, Lenovo has plunked down an estimated $65 million to associate itself with the Winter Olympic Games in Turin, Italy, next February and the Summer Games in Beijing in 2008. It also will start pairing IBM's ThinkPad name with its own.</p>              <p>The biggest challenge will be figuring out how to use the Maytag and Haier brands, says Michael Ip, the Asia-Pacific managing director of WPP Group branding consultancy Landor Associates, which is advising Lenovo on its transition. ""What does Haier bring to Maytag? How do you position the two so there is no overlap and you maximize efficiencies?""</p>              <p>Part of the answer lies in how American consumers will respond to a Chinese brand. Despite problems in China with product counterfeiting, worker abuses and sometimes-poor quality control, it is increasingly clear that U.S. shoppers don't much care about the origins of brands.</p>              <p>A study conducted last fall for WPP's Ogilvy &amp; Mather in the U.S., U.K., and France found that Western consumers are open to Chinese- brand products -- if they offer something unique. While 36% of the American consumers in the survey associated Chinese brands with low- cost products, 26% also associated them with innovation, and 24% with advanced features and value for money.</p>              <p>Well beyond getting the branding right, China's new global players must pull off some ambitious marriages. In the case of TCL and RCA, executives say they have encountered more financial and operational difficulties than they had expected. Factory costs in Europe and North America are running higher than anticipated in the TV venture, forcing the company to delay its target for bringing the operations into the black.</p>              <p>The biggest hurdle, though, has been finding enough people who can bridge Chinese and Western business cultures. ""Maybe Haier has the people,"" says Vincent Yan, a managing director of TCL. ""We needed cross-cultural people with the right business experience. Those are very hard to accumulate.""</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Qiu Haixu and Evan Ramstad contributed to this article.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>                          New Ownership<br/> <br/>  Household names controlled by Asian corporations:<br/> <br/>  COMPANY: Zenith Electronics<br/>  OWNER: LG Electronics, Korea<br/> <br/>  COMPANY: Columbia Pictures<br/>  OWNER: Sony, Japan<br/> <br/>  COMPANY: RCA (televisions)<br/>  OWNER: TCL, China; Thomson, France<br/> <br/>  COMPANY: IBM (PC unit)<br/>  OWNER: Lenovo, China<br/> <br/>  Source: WSJ research<br/></p>                      "

But at whose expense? We suspect the big losers are not so much the Chinese but rather Unocal shareholders, who will have to take a lower price for their shares.</p>              <p>Cnooc's offer was about $1 billion higher than what American-owned Chevron Corp. has put on the table. Had it not been for six weeks of congressional jaw-boning against the Cnooc offer, there's a strong likelihood a bidding war with Chevron might have prompted Cnooc to raise the price further.</p>              <p>This awkward affair follows on the Bush Administration's misguided demands that China revalue the yuan and the tariff measures directed at Chinese imports introduced in both Houses of Congress. So we now have a fissure in U.S.-China relations at a time when $250 billion a year in two-way trade flows are unambiguously enriching both nations.</p>              <p>The mystery is why the Washington celebration over Cnooc's stand- down. To be sure, China is a nation with inexcusably suppressed political freedom and way too much state intrusion in the economy. We too were troubled that Cnooc is quasi-state owned. But it is a good thing for Americans if the Chinese use their increasing economic clout and the dollars they accumulate from trade to bid up the value of U.S. assets.</p>              <p>And since there is one global price for oil, whether Unocal's resources are owned by a Chinese or American firm has no bearing on the price Americans pay for gas. China, like the U.S., is a major importer of oil; Cnooc would have had every incentive to pump oil to keep it on the market.</p>              <p>A zero-sum neurosis has taken hold on Capitol Hill that the Chinese, with their double-digit rates of economic growth, are creating too much wealth and that all this wealth is coming at America's expense. The real lesson of China's economic miracle of the past decade is that capitalism works. The lesson of the failed Cnooc deal with Unocal is that there are still too many mercantilists in Washington.</p>                      "
"223","2005-06-23","China's Cnooc Lobs In Rival Bid To Acquire Unocal; Oil Firm's $18.5 Billion Offer Aims to Knock Out Chevron; Concerns in Washington","398977973","Wall Street Journal","A.1","            >                                        >                          <p>Cnooc Ltd., China's third-largest oil company, made an unsolicited $18.5 billion cash bid for U.S. oil company Unocal Corp. late yesterday in an effort to break up its pending $16.5 billion acquisition by Chevron Corp.</p>              <p>The effort is by far the largest foreign acquisition ever attempted by a Chinese company, and marks the first time Chinese and U.S. companies have engaged in a takeover battle. The move could set off political fireworks in Washington, feeding larger concerns there about China's growing global economic ambitions. It also is the latest sign of China's hunger to gain direct control over more energy assets to feed its booming economy.</p>              <p>Cnooc is offering $67 a share for Unocal, and would have to pay a $500 million breakup fee to Chevron while assuming Unocal's $1.6 billion in debt. Both Chevron and Cnooc are bracing for a protracted battle and have hired public-relations firms to press their respective agendas.</p>              <p>In a statement, Cnooc described its offer as ""friendly"" and Chairman and Chief Executive Fu Chengyu said it hoped to agree on a ""consensual transaction."" Cnooc said its deal made sense for its shareholders, since it would strengthen its base in Asia, make its portfolio more balanced by boosting natural-gas reserves and be accretive to earnings.</p>              <p>But it also tried to head off concerns in Washington and elsewhere about Chinese ownership, saying it is willing to sell and market most or all of the oil and gas produced from Unocal's U.S. properties in U.S. markets and that it would seek to retain substantially all of Unocal's 6,500 employees.</p>              <p>""Our all-cash offer is clearly superior for Unocal shareholders,"" Mr. Fu said in an interview. ""Second, it is good for America. We will protect Unocal's U.S. jobs."" Chevron spokesman Donald Campbell said his company has not made any decisions about layoffs, but does expect to sell $2 billion in assets and consolidate its headquarters with Unocal's.</p>              <p>For Cnooc, an acquisition of Unocal would increase its sway and power in Asia. Nearly half of Unocal's reserves, the oil and natural gas equivalent of 1.75 billion barrels, consists of natural gas in Asia -- which China wants to keep its plants running. Overall, a combined entity would have 85% of its reserves in Asia, according to Cnooc's bid proposal.</p>              <p>Unocal has gas or oil fields in Thailand, Indonesia and Myanmar, complementing the offshore Chinese, Indonesian and Australian holdings of Cnooc. Unocal also owns a 10% stake in a big Azerbaijan field and pipeline operated by BP PLC, which is to move oil to the Mediterranean. A successful Cnooc bid would give the company a lot of oil to sell in the Atlantic market and would mark one of the only times a Chinese company acquired even a minority share in a top-tier project.</p>              <p>The play for Unocal marks a surprising turnaround for Cnooc, which went to the brink of lobbing in a bid for the company in April before Unocal agreed to be bought by Chevron in a cash-and-stock transaction. Mr. Fu said Cnooc withheld its earlier planned bid in April because nonexecutive directors wanted more time to examine a deal.</p>              <p>After withdrawing, the board hired advisers, CRA International Inc. and N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons, to examine whether it should revive a bid for Unocal. Directors held a meeting about a revived bid at Cnooc headquarters last night in Beijing, and investment bankers and the company's senior management worked through dawn to put together a formal offer. Mr. Fu said that all the directors who voted yesterday gave their approval to the new bid.</p>              <p>People familiar with the episode said Kenneth Courtis, vice chairman in Asia for investment bank Goldman Sachs and a nonexecutive director, was the first to express doubts about the earlier bid. A person familiar with the matter said Mr. Courtis recused himself from voting on Cnooc's renewed bid, since Goldman Sachs is providing financing. Mr. Courtis didn't respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment in recent weeks.</p>              <p>Late yesterday, Unocal, of El Segundo, Calif., said it intends to evaluate the Cnooc proposal in light of its ""fiduciary duties and its obligations under the Chevron agreement."" A company statement noted that the board's recommendation that shareholders approve the acquisition by Chevron ""remains in effect.""</p>              <p>Chevron issued a statement saying its original agreement to buy Unocal ""combines compelling value, regulatory certainty and accelerated timing, providing a superior transaction for Unocal stockholders."" Chevron has been pushing hard to expedite a vote on its offer by Unocal shareholders, but one hasn't been scheduled yet. A senior Chevron official said this week he hoped to have the deal wrapped up by August, but that was before Cnooc's move.</p>              <p>The competing bid could force Chevron to focus on the time-consuming regulatory process and advertising what it sees as risks of a Cnooc deal. It also could prompt Chevron to sweeten its offer, which Wall Street viewed in April as pricey. Cnooc's new offer may not be a knockout punch, since it falls short of the $70 a share that some stockholders expected.</p>              <p>Unocal's largest institutional shareholders include mutual-fund investment managers such as Dodge &amp; Cox and Capital Research &amp; Management Co., as well as hedge funds such as York Capital Management. Those firms either declined to comment or couldn't be reached last night.</p>              <p>Shares of Unocal had risen in recent days on rumors of a Cnooc bid, and closed up a penny at $64.86 yesterday in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, before Cnooc announced it bid. Shares of Chevron were down 51 cents at $58.27 in trading on the Big Board.</p>              <p>Cnooc, which has a market capitalization of about $22 billion, is about 70%-owned by the Chinese government, with the rest of its shares traded in New York and Hong Kong stock exchanges. Its American depositary receipts closed up 61 cents at $53.31 in 4 p.m. trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>              <p>Cnooc's offer comes at a time when oil prices have been steadily rising, in part because of China's rapidly growing demand, squeezing supplies world-wide. To fuel its industries and power the increasingly affluent lives of its 1.3 billion people, China has risen to be the world's second-biggest user of oil, after the U.S.</p>              <p>China's interest in acquiring oil assets can be seen in the proposed financing of Cnooc's bid. Of the $16 billion in pledges the company said it has received for its bid, $13 billion comes from state-owned Chinese entities, including $7 billion in long-term and short-term loans from Cnooc's parent, China National Offshore Oil Corp.</p>              <p>But Mr. Fu played down the role of the Chinese national interests in Cnooc's strategy, saying the bid was made on the merit of commercial considerations. He suggested that Chinese government approval for the bid was indirect, coming in the form of permission for state-owned lenders to loan money to Cnooc.</p>              <p>An additional $3 billion in bridge loans is coming from Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan Chase, Cnooc said.</p>              <p>Rising oil prices over the past 18 months have made it more expensive for all oil companies to acquire new reserves at prices allowing them to reliably make profits over long periods of time. The price of oil futures for August delivery closed at $58.09 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down 95 cents for the day.</p>              <p>The play for Unocal also is the latest sign of China's shift from a passive investor in U.S. Treasury bonds to an active investor with deep pockets. In May, China's Lenovo Group purchased International Business Machines Corp.'s personal-computer unit for $1.75 billion, and just this week Qingdao Haier Co. put in a $1.13 billion bid for venerable appliance maker Maytag Corp.</p>              <p>The mere possibility of a Cnooc bid already has stirred Washington. Yesterday, Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman emphasized that a bid would be reviewed by the Committee for Foreign Investment in the U.S., an interagency panel chaired by Treasury Secretary John Snow that screens such deals for national security concerns. Last week, U.S. Reps. Richard Pombo and Duncan Hunter, both Republicans from California, the home state of both Unocal and Chevron, asked the Bush administration to review and possibly block any Cnooc bid.</p>              <p>Today, the Senate Finance Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on the evolving U.S.-Chinese economic relationship. Among the issues: whether Beijing's currency-management practices are designed to give Chinese firms an unfair advantage over U.S. companies in the world marketplace. Both Treasury Secretary John Snow and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan are to testify.</p>              <p>Against that concern, however, U.S. corporations are pushing hard for continued access to China. On Tuesday, amid rumors of Cnooc bid, Exxon Mobil Corp. Chief Executive Lee Raymond said it would be a ""big mistake"" for the U.S. to block the bid. ""You have to have free trade,"" Mr. Raymond said during an appearance at an energy summit sponsored by Reuters. ""If you start to put inefficiencies in the system, all of us eventually pay for that.""</p>              <p>Even if Cnooc's bid wins, it could face big challenges in absorbing and integrating a company that had $8.2 billion in revenue last year. A bid also would leave Cnooc awash in debt taken on to finance the deal.</p>              <p>Cnooc, pronounced ""see-nook,"" is in many ways the most westernized of China's three state-owned oil and gas companies. Created in the early 1980s to explore and develop undersea oil and gas fields, it has just 2,500 employees, compared with the tens of thousands who work at its two state-owned peers. Cnooc has been increasing its investments in natural gas and building liquefied-natural-gas receiving-terminals along China's southern coast, providing a major market for any Asian gas Cnooc might acquire from Unocal.</p>              <p>Through numerous offshore oil-development joint ventures with foreign oil majors -- including several with Chevron -- Cnooc has had broad exposure to Western management and technology. Mr. Fu, the Cnooc CEO, studied for a time in the U.S. and in the 1990s served as vice president of the China business of Phillips Petroleum Co., now part of ConocoPhillips. Mr. Fu ""has ambitions to expand the business, but knows how to reach his goals following Western business rules,"" said Han Xiaoping, who consults for Chinese and international energy companies at Beijing-based Falcon Pioneer Technology Co.</p>              <p>Last night, Mr. Fu said he remembered Unocal's trademark 76 gas stations from his days living in California in the 1980s, when he earned a master's degree from the University of Southern California. ""I never dreamed of this,"" he said of the chances a Chinese company could own Unocal, which owned the brand until 1997. ""I thought that China was 100 years behind the U.S.""</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Greg Hitt in Washington contributed to this article.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>                               Stocking Up?<br/> <br/>  Total 2004 net proven reserves, in billions of barrels of oil equivalent<br/> <br/>Cnooc .......................... 2.23<br/>Unocal ......................... 1.75<br/> <br/>  Sources: the companies<br/></p>                      "

Chevron and Unocal made a deal for a lower price on April 4 that Cnooc tried to break up with its own bid in late June.</p>              <p>In reaching for Unocal, Cnooc -- considered one of China's most modern and Western-minded companies -- showed its relative inexperience in the world of Wall Street and Washington, with some strategic and political stumbles. But Cnooc also got caught up in anti-Chinese sentiment over some very different issues, ranging from textile trade to intellectual property to military spending.</p>              <p>It was a mood of annoyance at China that Chevron lobbyists skillfully exploited on Capitol Hill over the past few weeks. What finally doomed the Cnooc bid was a provision Congress inserted in the energy bill last week that would have delayed for months completion of any Cnooc takeover of Unocal.</p>              <p>In a harshly worded statement, Cnooc blamed ""the unprecedented political opposition"" in the U.S. and a ""political environment"" that ""made it very difficult for us to accurately assess our chances of success."" Though Cnooc's $18.5 billion all-cash offer was $700 million above Chevron's, even after a Chevron increase in July, investors said the considerable uncertainty about when Cnooc could close diminished the value of the Chinese bid.</p>              <p>Cnooc's withdrawal came just a short time after the Chinese central bank let the yuan rise slightly against the dollar. That move also came in the wake of intense U.S. pressure, in that case from manufacturers who said China's currency controls gave it an unfair advantage. So the Cnooc move marked the second Chinese reversal of course in three weeks on an issue where U.S.-Chinese relations had grown tense.</p>              <p>Now the question is whether Cnooc's move will tend to calm the political and economic environment or only fan the flames. Leaders of both Washington and Beijing have been hoping to create a less-charged dialogue, with Chinese President Hu Jintao visiting the U.S. next month.</p>              <p>U.S. feelings about the Chinese bid for Unocal no doubt were especially strong because it concerned oil, a commodity about which both nations are increasingly anxious. U.S. reactions weren't nearly so strong to Chinese bids for International Business Machines Corp.'s PC unit -- which was successful -- and Iowa appliance maker Maytag Corp. -- which was dropped.</p>              <p>The Unocal affair left a bitter taste for some in China. ""Free trade for the U.S. isn't really free and fair, it's just what's best for the U.S.,"" said Xing Houyuan, of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, a think tank.</p>              <p>There was concern among some analysts about possible Chinese retaliation for the congressional interference. Jason Kindopp, an analyst for the Eurasia Group, said the Chinese government may favor European over U.S. companies for certain big-ticket purchases such as airplanes or power-generation turbines.</p>              <p>But others argued that Beijing didn't appear to be pushing the Cnooc deal directly, and therefore wasn't likely to retaliate. And even if it were to make a statement by interfering with a symbolically important deal, no one expects an interruption in the powerful currents of trade and investment now flowing between the two nations. U.S. companies have spent billions of dollars setting up factories in China and now depend on them to keep their costs low; China depends on the jobs they bring.</p>              <p>""It's a minor hiccup and nothing more,"" said Nick Seddon, managing director at DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary law firm in Hong Kong.</p>              <p>The economic tensions follow two decades of increasing commercial integration between the U.S. and China, a trend that increased after China's entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001. Trade between the U.S. and China has grown at a phenomenal pace, to $231 billion in 2004 from $116.3 billion in 2000.</p>              <p>Americans have done most of the buying and the Chinese most of the selling: The U.S. posted a $162 billion trade deficit with China last year, up from $84 billion in 2000. Despite the American hand-wringing about the Cnooc deal, China has opened up significantly to U.S. investment, with U.S. multinationals -- from banks to automakers to computer companies -- buying stakes in Chinese firms or opening factories in China.</p>              <p>For all of Cnooc's complaints about American politics, the company was also undermined by some of its own missteps. The bid was the largest takeover try ever by a Chinese company, and it involved White House-connected lobbyists and an army of Wall Street advisers and media strategists. Cnooc's chief executive, 54-year-old Fu Chengyu, speaks English and studied petroleum engineering at the University of Southern California.</p>              <p>One of the most costly Cnooc mistakes came in March, before any offers for Unocal had been made. At the time, Cnooc had an edge over other likely bidders: Chevron (then called ChevronTexaco) and ENI SpA of Italy. Mr. Fu had been talking to Unocal Chief Executive Charles Williamson for months, and Unocal liked Cnooc's idea of retaining most of Unocal's staff. Unocal called for final bids to be submitted on March 30.</p>              <p>But a day before then, Mr. Fu said Cnooc couldn't submit a proposal in time, opening the way for Chevron to strike a deal a few days later for $16.7 billion in cash and stock. It turned out Mr. Fu was meeting resistance from his own board, say people close to Cnooc, because the board hadn't been briefed on the plan until quite recently.</p>              <p>With oil's price steadily climbing, however, Mr. Fu's move finally won Cnooc board support in late June. By then, the challenge was more daunting: Cnooc would have to break up a tentative deal between two American companies. Among the obstacles: a $500 million ""breakup fee"" that was due Chevron if Cnooc succeeded.</p>              <p>Some U.S. lawmakers began fighting the Cnooc bid while it was still just a rumor. Two powerful Republican committee chairmen, Richard Pombo and Duncan Hunter -- both of California, where both Chevron and Unocal are based -- wrote to President Bush days before Cnooc's June 22 bid urging an investigation of the national-security implications. ""We fear that American companies will find it increasingly difficult to compete against China's state-owned and/or controlled energy companies,"" they wrote. Mr. Pombo also raised the issue with Vice President Cheney.</p>              <p>Mr. Pombo's California district includes San Ramon, where Chevron is based. (Unocal is in El Segundo.) Chevron launched a lobbying effort that included helping legislators of both parties write to Mr. Bush criticizing Cnooc's bid as unfair, on the ground it was backed by low- interest loans from Chinese state-owned institutions. Chevron hired a roster of prominent Washington lobbyists including Wayne Berman, an official in the first Bush administration and one of the president's top fund-raisers, and Drew Maloney, a former aide to Texas Rep. Tom DeLay.</p>              <p>Chevron rolled out its Scottish-born vice chairman, Peter Robertson, for TV shows and newspaper interviews. Its lobbyists hammered on the issues of Chinese subsidies and fair trade, pushing members of Congress to wonder whether China would allow a U.S. company to make a similar play for a Chinese firm.</p>              <p>Cnooc brought in its own heavy hitters, from the Washington law firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld, and later added veteran lobbyist Charlie Black to help woo Republicans. The law firm put at least seven attorneys on the job full time.</p>              <p>For some lawmakers, just the fact that Cnooc was Chinese was reason enough to worry. Rep. Frank Wolf, a Virginia Republican known for his defense of religious rights in China, wrote an angry letter to Cnooc's law firm. ""I question the appropriateness of a distinguished American firm like Akin Gump advising and ultimately being on the payroll of the Chinese Communist government -- a government which poses a growing national security threat and blatantly disrespects free trade norms, human rights, religious freedom and political dissent,"" he wrote.</p>              <p>At the end of June, lawmakers voted a resolution calling on the administration to review any Cnooc deal for Unocal. That elicited an angry response from the Chinese Foreign Ministry: ""We demand that the U.S. Congress correct its mistaken ways of politicizing economic and trade issues and stop interfering in the normal commercial exchanges....""</p>              <p>This response seemed to stir even more ire in Congress. The push for the White House to study the Cnooc bid's economic and national- security implications would have stalled any Cnooc deal at least six months. Unsure of White House support, lawmakers ended up striking a deal last week and inserting into the energy bill a study requirement that would have put the Cnooc deal on hold for at least 141 days.</p>              <p>Noticeably absent from the fray was the Bush administration, which took no public stance on the bid, but also did little to quell the extremely rare move by Congress to interfere in a merger deal.</p>              <p>The congressional backlash affected institutional investors. After Cnooc in June topped Chevron's offer by nearly $2 billion, Jason Putman, an energy analyst at KeyCorp's Victory Capital Management, a big holder of Unocal shares, figured Cnooc wouldn't have much trouble closing the deal within six months.</p>              <p>But after seeing the intensity of Washington opposition, he reworked his calculations. This time, he figured it would take nine months for Cnooc to close and that the chance of government approval wasn't as high. In his view, Cnooc's all-cash bid had lost about $513 million in value simply because it was now riskier. So whether Cnooc's bid or Chevron's was actually better, he now felt, was too close to call.</p>              <p>Cnooc offered to increase its bid by $552 million in cash -- provided Unocal would agree to lobby Congress for its bid. Unocal declined, citing prohibitions in its April merger agreement with Chevron.</p>              <p>Then on July 19, Chevron sweetened its bid. Although it remained $800 million below Cnooc's and wasn't all cash as Cnooc's was, many institutional investors were so concerned about Cnooc's ability to navigate the federal approval process that they began to lean toward Chevron -- sealing the fate of the Cnooc bid.</p>              <p>The six-week drama has bruised Cnooc's image, and also its growth strategy. While U.S. politicians portrayed the company as an extension of the Chinese Communist Party, industry officials say Cnooc is relatively insulated from the kind of direct involvement Beijing takes in the affairs of the parent companies of Cnooc's two larger domestic rivals, PetroChina and Sinopec Corp. Cnooc Ltd. is a 70%-owned unit of state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp.</p>              <p>""This is a commercial deal,"" Cnooc CEO Mr. Fu said in a June interview. ""It is part of the process of globalization which the U.S. government has strongly supported.""</p>              <p>It is an explanation that jibes with a broader trend in China: Beijing's diminishing involvement in the management of even large state-owned corporations. In China's increasingly freewheeling economic environment, loans from state institutions aren't necessarily an indication of central-government support for a project or acquisition.</p>              <p>Public discourse in China about Cnooc's bid provides additional clues that the company isn't following orders from Beijing. Chinese state-run media routinely give glowing coverage to government-backed initiatives. But stories about the Cnooc bid spanned a wide range of viewpoints, coverage more typically reserved for matters in which Beijing doesn't have a serious interest.</p>              <p>The failed bid sets back Mr. Fu's ambition to expand Cnooc in one fell swoop rather than through piecemeal overseas investments. Its options for picking up sizable oil and gas assets in Asia are limited, with many of Asia's best prizes locked up by oil companies in countries that harbor the same desire for long-term energy security as China.</p>              <p>Once the deal closes, Chevron will become the largest Western energy company in the Asia-Pacific region in terms of reserves of oil and natural gas. Yet Chevron will need China as a customer, particularly for a Chevron-led gas project off the Australian coast known as Gorgon, where Cnooc has tentatively agreed to pay $22 billion for a 12.5% ownership stake and a 25-year-supply of gas. Negotiations on that are continuing. ""The owners of Gorgon need the Chinese more than the Chinese need Gorgon,"" says Houston energy investment banker Matthew Simmons.</p>              <p>Cnooc's failed bid for Unocal could end up strengthening Chinese resolve to acquire and directly control overseas assets, rather than rely on the global oil market to meet China's fast-growing demand for crude. In China, the moves by the U.S. Congress have added to widely held suspicions that Washington is choking off China's access to sources of energy. China has expressed interest in buying into Canada's vast oil sands and various projects to produce liquefied natural gas for shipment overseas.</p>              <p>From the U.S. diplomatic perspective, there's a risk that Chinese energy companies, mandated to provide for China's massive and growing energy needs, will increase their dealings with ""rogue states"" if they can't buy Western-controlled energy assets. China National Petroleum Corp. and China Petrochemical Corp. have made deals in Iran and Sudan against the wishes of Washington. Cnooc's failure to secure energy reserves through a different route has bolstered the view that China has little choice but to search for energy in countries the U.S. shuns.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Dennis K.

Flowers &amp; Co., according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>              <p>A potential investment by China Investment Corp., which has $200 billion in assets, would be the latest sign that the newly formed government investment fund hasn't been deterred by the criticism it faced from investing in another buyout firm, Blackstone Group LP.</p>              <p>CIC invested $3 billion in Blackstone last year right before the U.S. company's initial public offering, only to see the investment decline sharply in value along with Blackstone's stock as the buyout business fizzled. In December, CIC invested $5 billion in Morgan Stanley for a nearly 10% stake in the New York investment bank.</p>              <p>Lou Jiwei, chairman of CIC and former vice minister of finance for China, said last week that the state investment fund was looking to invest in ""portfolios"" of companies, rather than individual firms.</p>              <p>An investment in a fund managed by J.C. Flowers would fit that criterion. J.C. Flowers, which is run by former Goldman Sachs banker J. Christopher Flowers, has made a name for itself investing in distressed financial institutions. The firm made headlines recently for backing out of buying student-loan provider SLM Corp., better known as Sallie Mae, for $25 billion.</p>              <p>By investing in a new fund being formed by J.C. Flowers, CIC would be able to indirectly invest in different companies and also inoculate itself from any political backlash that could arise from investing directly in iconic American companies.</p>              <p>CIC's investment in J.C. Flowers's new fund would differ from its investment in Blackstone. The investment fund invested directly in Blackstone, buying a nearly 10% stake in the private-equity firm, whereas its investment in J.C. Flowers would be indirect, or made as a limited partner through one of J.C. Flowers's funds.</p>              <p>In recent months, government investment funds in Asia and the Middle East have made investments in a number of big Wall Street banks. Besides the Morgan Stanley and Blackstone sales, UBS AG, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Citigroup Inc. have also sold stakes to government- controlled entities. Private-equity firms have sold pieces to these funds, too. Last year, Apollo Management LP and Carlyle Group sold pieces of themselves to an investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government.</p>              <p>A spokeswoman for CIC said she was unaware of any discussions.

A decision from the El Segundo, Calif., firm could come in the next few days, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>              <p>Of likely concern to the Unocal board: Would Cnooc raise its $67 per-share bid to help unseat Chevron's existing takeover plan, which is just weeks away from closing? And, if so, how would Unocal and Cnooc confront the fierce political opposition that has broken out in Washington, where Congress wants to stymie Chinese ambitions for the U.S. oil and gas company?</p>              <p>This is the second time in a week that Unocal's 10-person board has met to consider whether Cnooc's offer, which the management recently fine-tuned after meetings with Unocal negotiators, is better for shareholders than Chevron's offer. The contest for Unocal, potentially the largest energy deal in years, has rankled Washington because Cnooc is 70%-owned by the Chinese government and the offer is partly financed by state banks.</p>              <p>If the Unocal board doesn't change its recommendation to favor the Chevron deal, Cnooc would have little choice but to raise its bid or else likely lose the proxy vote scheduled for Aug. 10.</p>              <p>As of yesterday evening, Cnooc had resisted raising its offer, despite the fact that the company's board had authorized an increase. It also has offered to sell off U.S. assets and said it welcomed a national-security review in hopes of heading off the political criticism.</p>              <p>Unocal shares traded down 1% on Friday, to close at $65.65, after hitting a record of $66.79 last week. Cnooc shares traded down about 4% last week, as shareholders anticipated a coming bidding war with Chevron, whose own shares were off about 1% for the week.</p>              <p>In April, Unocal's board agreed to be acquired by Chevron in a cash- and-stock deal now valued at $16.5 billion. The smooth road to consummation of the deal was interrupted last month when Cnooc lobbed an $18.5 billion cash offer at Unocal.</p>              <p>While the Cnooc deal places a higher value on Unocal, shareholders and the Unocal board have been hesitant to embrace it. The Chinese interest in Unocal continues to attract protest from Congress -- and regulatory approval could take months. A Chevron acquisition has already received federal antitrust approval and would close in a matter of weeks.</p>                      "
"228","2007-12-21","Morgan's Helping Hand in China; Ardent Mack Aide From Beijing Lends Stature, Local Ties","398995559","Wall Street Journal","C.3","            >                                        >                          <p>BEIJING -- Morgan Stanley's landmark deal to sell a $5 billion stake in itself to China marks a bold move by Chief Executive John Mack. If it pans out, it also will owe some of its success to the long experience and local ties of Wei Sun Christianson, Mr. Mack's steadfast lieutenant and point woman in China.</p>              <p>The surprise deal, announced Wednesday, gives the state-owned China Investment Corp., or CIC, a stake of as much as 9.9% in Morgan Stanley at a time when the U.S. investment bank is staggering under a multibillion-dollar write-down. While initiated by Mr. Mack, the agreement also helps solidify Ms. Christianson's status as one of China's premier deal makers, and perhaps the country's most prominent female investment banker.</p>              <p>The 51-year-old Ms. Christianson, born in Beijing, hails from a pioneering generation of Chinese who went abroad to study in the early years of China's economic overhauls and later returned to help reshape the country's financial system. Among the fellow Chinese she met in New York while studying at Columbia University School of Law in the late 1980s was Gao Xiqing, a Duke University-trained lawyer who later helped found China's stock markets. Mr. Gao today is president and chief investment officer of CIC, which was founded in September to manage $200 billion of China's $1.4 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves.</p>              <p>It isn't clear precisely what role Ms. Christianson and Mr. Gao, both of whom were in New York for Wednesday's announcement, played in the deal. Ms. Christianson declined to comment, and Mr. Gao couldn't be reached. But their involvement in the tie-up reflects the rising profile of their generation of Chinese in global finance, as China becomes an important force in world markets.</p>              <p>The CIC investment could prove a boon to both CIC and Morgan Stanley, although it also risks feeding suspicions among some U.S. politicians that the Chinese fund is seeking to obtain control of strategic assets -- something CIC officials have long denied. For Morgan Stanley, it provides an infusion of capital, while for CIC the bet could prove lucrative if the U.S. investment bank is able to successfully emerge from its current woes.</p>              <p>CIC's strategy under Mr. Gao and his boss, Lou Jiwei, a former Chinese vice minister of finance, appears to be a mix of opportunistic big bets and more restrained portfolio investment. The $200 billion fund's managers emphasize that they plan to invest their money ""passively"" and to farm out most of the $67 billion they have allocated for overseas markets to external money managers. At the same time, Mr. Gao and his colleagues have shown an appetite for prominent deals with the Morgan Stanley stake and a $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group LP earlier this year.</p>              <p>Ms. Christianson has spent much of her career working with Mr. Mack, following him when he left Morgan Stanley in 2002 to join Credit Suisse Group, departing from Credit Suisse when he was ousted in 2004, then rejoining Morgan Stanley in early 2006 after Mr. Mack's return there. In between, she spent 14 months as Citigroup Inc.'s lead investment banker in China.</p>              <p>Ms. Christianson didn't set out to be a banker. Growing up during the Cultural Revolution, a period of chaos from 1966 to 1976 when much of China ceased to function, she was unable to go to college until the late 1970s. When she could, she enrolled at a language institute in Beijing to study English and was on track to become a translator at the foreign ministry.</p>              <p>Eager to attend graduate school, she jumped at a chance to go to the U.S. in the 1980s. She graduated with honors in 1985 from Amherst College in Massachusetts, becoming the school's first China-born graduate, before attending Columbia's law school on a scholarship. It was at Columbia that she met her husband, with whom she has three sons.</p>              <p>New York at the time was home to a small and tight-knit group of Chinese students studying law and finance -- subjects almost completely alien to a generation that had grown up with Maoism. Mr. Gao, who had graduated from Duke in 1986, was working at the now- defunct law firm Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander &amp; Ferdon.</p>              <p>""At the time, most Chinese going overseas were aiming to study science,"" said Li Xiaoming, a friend of Mr. Gao's who graduated from Duke's law school in 1990 and is now managing partner of White &amp; Case's Beijing office. ""There were probably about ten Chinese lawyers then at Wall Street firms, making it a close group."" Ms. Christianson and Mr. Gao remained friends as she climbed the investment-banking ladder and he rose through the ranks of China's bureaucracy.</p>              <p>After helping found the stock markets, Mr. Gao became vice chairman and chief executive officer of Bank of China's investment-banking arm and later served as vice chairman of the country's securities regulator and its national social-security fund.</p>              <p>Ms. Christianson briefly served as a regulator at the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission. After her third child was born, she decided she wanted a career switch and jumped into finance. Morgan Stanley gave Ms. Christianson her first break in 1998. ""I was willing to try and ready to fail,"" she said in an earlier interview.</p>              <p>Today, Ms. Christianson, Mr. Gao and others of their generation are perpetuating the tradition they helped establish, by recruiting Chinese talent from overseas. CIC, for example, recently hired Li Yingru, a young Chinese who studied in the U.S. and had spent about a year and a half working at the California Public Employees' Retirement System.</p>                      "
"229","2005-06-24","China's Oil Thirst","398996493","Wall Street Journal","A.12","            >                                        >                          <p>The $18.5 billion bid by China's Cnooc Ltd. to acquire Unocal is going to test America's mettle on two big questions: free trade, and the larger U.S. foreign-policy strategy of giving China a stake in the global economy.</p>              <p>Cnooc says the bid is ""friendly"" but it is also designed to trump a previous $16.5 billion offer by U.S. oil giant Chevron. The all-cash offer ""is clearly superior for Unocal shareholders,"" declared Cnooc CEO Fu Chengyu, in capitalist lingo that could have come from any Wall Street M&amp;A player. Cnooc is China's third largest oil company and it seems willing to pay a premium to boost reserves to meet that country's voracious demand for energy.</p>              <p>This being a Chinese offer, Cnooc will also have to run a U.S. political gauntlet. A pair of California Republicans, Duncan Hunter and Richard Pombo, have sent President Bush a letter warning that the bid for America's ninth-largest oil company ""raises many concerns about U.S. jobs, energy production and energy security."" They want the bid referred to the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment, an interagency panel charged with ensuring that sales don't threaten national security.</p>              <p>A review is fine, but the decision of whether to accept the Cnooc offer ought to rest with Unocal shareholders, as it would on nearly any other takeover bid. Unocal has substantial oil and gas assets in Asia and in that sense looks like a plausible business fit. The U.S. has also been rightly urging China to lift its capital controls, so shutting off the U.S. market to Chinese capital would look just a tad hypocritical. By the way, financing for the offer is being provided in part by Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan Chase, two very Yankee firms.</p>              <p>As for U.S. security, Congressional protectionists might want to consider the consequences of denying this bid. If U.S. or free-world energy assets are off-limits, China will be only too happy to cut deals with the world's pariah states.</p>              <p>That includes Iran, where China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corp. last year signed a contract to secure natural gas supplies for the next 20 years. Beijing has since worked hard to keep Tehran's nuclear ambitions off the U.N. Security Council's agenda. The same applies to Sudan, where China National Petroleum Corp. is the largest investor in the oil industry. It's no accident that Beijing has sought to tone down U.N. resolutions critical of the Darfur atrocities abetted by the government in Khartoum.</p>              <p>Cnooc is largely state-owned but it is also the most Westernized of the country's oil companies. Most of China's state-owned companies have tens of thousands of workers for reasons of political patronage, but Cnooc has only 2,500. Its CEO was educated in the U.S., and the company has aggressively sought foreign joint ventures. It is precisely the kind of public-private hybrid company we'd expect to see as China continues its transition from Communist to capitalist.</p>              <p>If state-owned companies were banned from buying U.S. assets, more than a few European, Latin and Asian companies would have to divest what they already own. We can envision some Chinese acquisitions that might deserve to be blocked, but the bar ought to be high and limited to serious security issues. The assets of a publicly traded energy company don't meet that test.</p>              <p>Dealing with an emerging power like China is no easy task, and U.S. policy has wisely had two parts: inviting it into a web of free-market economic entanglements while pushing back when it issues military threats. The latter shows Beijing's Communist leaders that they will pay a price for reckless nationalism, while the former gives them a stake in global commerce and prosperity. Free trade also helps build a Chinese middle class that will eventually demand more political freedom.</p>              <p>This is a difficult balance to strike, but the Bush Administration has got it mostly right. A government rejection of a Unocal deal, assuming its shareholders approve, would send exactly the wrong signal to China and make it even harder for the U.S. to get cooperation on genuine security matters. The fact that a Chinese oil company wants to Buy American is a sign of progress, not concern.</p>                      "

An acquisition of Unocal, which has a market capitalization of $17.4 billion, would be the largest takeover in the oil sector in years.</p>              <p>It isn't clear exactly why the Chinese efforts to take over Unocal foundered suddenly. What is certain is that the interest expressed in January by Beijing-based China National Offshore, known as Cnooc (pronounced see-nook) forced other interested companies to come forward to bid on the 115-year-old Unocal company.</p>              <p>Exact prices being discussed by the various bidders couldn't be learned last night; any buyer would also assume about $3 billion in debt. And it is still possible that Unocal may decide against doing a deal altogether, one person familiar with the matter said.</p>              <p>Unocal offers an attractive collection of oil and natural-gas reserves in the ground, at a time when energy companies are struggling to find enough new oil and natural gas to replace what they pump every year. Moreover, most of Unocal's best assets are in Southeast Asia, near the fast-growing Chinese and Indian economies that are both consuming rapidly increasing amounts of energy.</p>              <p>Other mergers could follow a purchase of Unocal as companies scramble to gobble up smaller but still sizable companies. Soaring energy prices have allowed oil companies to build up piles of cash and ramp up share-buyback programs, giving them plenty of resources for acquisitions.</p>              <p>While any deal is risky, especially because crude-oil prices have surged in recent weeks, it is increasingly difficult for any Western company to build a comparable portfolio through painstaking exploration. Meanwhile, Chinese and Indian national oil companies are scouring the globe for new oil and gas reserves, driving up prices and intensifying competition.</p>              <p>In addition to Unocal, Occidental Petroleum Corp., Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and Devon Energy Corp. are considered possible takeover targets.</p>              <p>All the bidders have their own reasons for coveting Unocal. ChevronTexaco, the second-largest U.S. oil company, is under pressure to restock its cupboard of prospects for future growth. Last year, the San Ramon, Calif., company didn't sanction a single large-scale project and replaced a dismal 18% of the oil and gas it pumped out of the ground -- ending an 11-year streak of finding more than it produced.</p>              <p>Thanks to sky-high oil and gas prices, it posted a $13.3 billion profit in 2004, a record for the company, and the company is sitting on $9.3 billion in cash, more than double what it had a year ago. A company spokesman didn't return calls seeking comment.</p>              <p>Rome's Eni, the sixth-largest publicly traded oil company in the world by reserves, has global ambitions. But while it has operations from Europe's North Sea to Nigeria in Africa and the former Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan, it lacks significant operations in Southeast Asia. Acquiring Unocal would fix that gap in its global portfolio.</p>              <p>An Eni spokeswoman said the company didn't have a comment on the auction process.</p>              <p>Cnooc's interest in Unocal, El Segundo, Calif., comes as China's intense thirst for oil and its willingness to pay top dollar have made it an aggressive buyer of natural resources around the world. But a Chinese company has never undertaken a purchase of the size and political resonance of Unocal, a fixture in the U.S. economy for more than a century.</p>              <p>Regardless of which company wins, the participation of Cnooc highlights China's rapid progress toward becoming a major player in the global energy industry. China recently overtook Japan as the No. 2 consumer of oil after the U.S. and has been on the hunt to secure enough energy supplies and reserves to keep its economy rapidly growing. In fact, China's growing appetite for energy has emboldened the three largest state-controlled oil companies: Cnooc, China National Petroleum Corp. and China Petrochemical Corp., known as Sinopec.</p>              <p>Unocal shares have climbed 75% in the past year and 8% last week, amid the general surge in oil prices and as word spread among investors that a deal could be close. Unocal has never officially acknowledged that it is up for sale.</p>              <p>Despite its U.S. roots, Unocal's primary value resides in its Asian oil assets, a collection of oil and natural-gas fields, mostly in areas easily accessible to China. Unocal has operations in Thailand, Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Bangladesh, in addition to Europe and a valuable minority stake in a large oilfield in Azerbaijan.</p>              <p>While Unocal has world-class assets, industry observers say a larger company could squeeze better margins from the projects.</p>              <p>Previously known for its ""76"" branded gasoline stations, Unocal sold its marketing and refining assets in 1997 and has focused exclusively on finding and developing oil and gas fields. The company, however, has been distracted in recent years by the unexpected death of a youthful chief executive and a long-running lawsuit involving allegations that slave labor had been used to build a pipeline partly owned by Unocal in Myanmar.</p>              <p>The case, however, was settled earlier this year, removing a potential barrier to any takeover.</p>              <p>Still, oil companies have reason to exercise caution.</p>              <p>Acquiring oil companies at today's lofty prices could be problematic if the price of crude oil tumbles, slashing the price of acquired assets. This is a major concern for publicly traded companies like ChevronTexaco and Eni, which likely would face investor unrest if they pay too much on a deal.</p>                      "

The Chinese company has engaged Morrow &amp; Co., a U.S. proxy-solicitation company, according to people familiar with Cnooc. For the time being, the company is holding steady with its offer of $67 a share and is closely monitoring developments in Washington, these people say.</p>              <p>Congress has played a significant role in the fight over Unocal, of El Segundo, Calif., and its array of oil and natural-gas assets in Asia and the U.S. Members of Congress have objected to the acquisition of acquiring a U.S. oil company by a state-controlled Chinese company.

The goal is to contain combustible anti-American sentiment that Cnooc's failure might ignite, they say.</p>              <p>""I think the Propaganda Department is trying to cool down the nationalist anger caused by this,"" said Li Xiguang, who teaches journalism at Tsinghua University in Beijing. ""The government wants to have strong ties with the U.S. despite this setback.""</p>              <p>Popular dissatisfaction with Washington runs high in China, fueled by American support for Taiwan and perceived U.S. bullying on trade matters. Many Chinese also expressed resentment at the recent revaluation of the country's currency as the latest indication that the U.S. is trying to push China around.</p>              <p>But the leadership in Beijing is intent on keeping relations with Washington as smooth as possible. For a few weeks after Cnooc's announcement in June that it was challenging Chevron Corp. to acquire Unocal, coverage in China's state-owned media was relatively freewheeling, with some criticizing the bid and others attacking U.S. lawmakers' efforts to thwart Cnooc.</p>              <p>But as it became clearer that Unocal would side with Chevron, despite Cnooc's substantially higher bid, the Propaganda Department issued its directive to newsrooms. A staff member of the Shanghai Oriental Morning Post said editors were called into a meeting where their boss informed them of the directive.</p>              <p>""All reports on Cnooc should use stories from Xinhua news agency in order to keep the same tone as the government,"" the staffer quoted the boss as saying. Editors at four other newspapers and a Shanghai television station contacted by The Wall Street Journal described similar scenes at their offices.</p>              <p>Beijing's desire for smooth U.S. relations notwithstanding, the Cnooc saga still could cause repercussions for American interests. The handful of permitted commentaries published in recent days have emphasized U.S. hypocrisy on free trade. The China Daily ran an editorial yesterday saying the consequences of the failed Cnooc bid ""may be more serious than some U.S. politicians have calculated.""</p>              <p>The lack of strongly critical news coverage didn't prevent many Chinese from tracking Cnooc's troubles in America or from drawing conclusions about it.

"233","2006-02-23","Ports in a Storm","398999576","Wall Street Journal","A.16","            >                                        >                          <p>The current dust-up over the proposed purchase of the British port company Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam by Dubai World Ports is like a fun-house mirror -- distorting our national politics, and our understanding of and engagement with the global economy.</p>              <p>P&amp;O currently operates parts of five major ports in the U.S., including Newark-Elizabeth, Baltimore, Miami and New Orleans. The Bush administration recently approved the proposed sale, which triggered bipartisan opposition on Capitol Hill and by governors across the country. Speaking for this coalition, Sen. Patrick Leahy intoned, ""Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike are rightly concerned about the Bush administration's decision to allow an Arab country with previous ties to terrorism to take over the operation of six U.S. shipping ports."" He called for a ""prompt and thorough investigation"" and was joined by a wide swath of Congress in calling for emergency legislation to prohibit companies owned by foreign governments from purchasing U.S. port operations.</p>              <p>There are at least three issues here. One is the specific concern about the deal itself; another is disquiet over the administration's approach to homeland security; and the last is a larger pattern of American unease about the changing global economy. What the potential deal highlights most of all is that the U.S. cannot have it both ways: We cannot both advocate a global system of free trade with low barriers of entry and then cry foul when foreign companies try to buy U.S. assets.</p>              <p>On the first point, what the disparate opponents have insinuated is that there is a relationship between the government of Dubai (which controls Dubai World Ports) and terrorist groups -- and that therefore the purchase of the port operator will endanger U.S. security. There are serious and legitimate concerns which must be addressed, but halting the deal is not a solution.</p>              <p>Dubai is rapidly becoming a major entrepot in the Middle East. Like Switzerland, it is a haven for assets owned by individuals who crave anonymity. It has become a duty-free shopping haven that actively courts global companies. It aims to become the financial hub for the region, with a new stock exchange and offices throughout the world. The ruling family currently owns property and assets across the globe -- including a minority share of the gambling and resort company Kerzner International and a controlling interest in the Essex House in New York and Madame Tussaud's of London. Dubai is, in fact, an example of global capitalism taking root in unlikely places, a hybrid cross between Miami and Singapore with a dollop of Las Vegas on the fringe of the Arabian Peninsula. And precisely for these reasons, it has as much to worry about from fundamentalist terrorism as the United States.</p>              <p>On the second point, the purchase allows critics to challenge the way the Bush administration has handled port security. That is an utterly crucial issue, for which the administration deserves criticism. Secure ports should never be sacrificed to economic expediency. Any port operator -- whether American, British or Arab -- must be required to prove its trustworthiness and competence to Congress (no less the American people), and be subject to utmost scrutiny and oversight or else prevented from having a prominent role in running them. In fact, security should never be sold to any company, regardless of where it is domiciled.</p>              <p>However, many American ports are currently operated by foreign entities, a fact which seems to have been overlooked. The port of Los Angeles has terminals run by companies from Taiwan, Denmark, Singapore and even China. The model the administration should follow is that of the airports, which are managed by private companies but whose security is the responsibility of the U.S. government. Yet while decrying the proposed sale is a way to score political points -- because the company is Arab and thus can be easily (and wrongly) equated with Islamic terrorism, and allows for revisiting a failing of the administration's homeland security policies -- it is not without considerable costs. Think of it: America says that it wants Muslim partners in its struggle against terrorism, yet politicians on both sides of the aisle are willing to tar a potential partner. The president may deserve attacking, but doing so in this way is truly cutting off our nose to spite our face.</p>              <p>Most troubling of all is the larger pattern of hyperbolic and xenophobic reactions against the tide of globalization. Strip away the particulars and the response to this current deal is almost identical to the reactions last summer when oil giant Unocal was nearly purchased by the Chinese company Cnooc. Then, Republican Rep. Richard Pombo warned that the deal could have ""disastrous consequences for our economic and national security,"" while Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden noted, ""Being a free-trader isn't synonymous with being a sucker and a patsy.""</p>              <p>Then and now, the response to an economic challenge has been to raise the flag of national security to prevent foreign companies from acquiring U.S. assets. At the time of the Unocal deal, a common rejoinder was, ""Well, the Chinese wouldn't let us acquire a vital asset of theirs,"" but then China began selling portions of its primary state-owned banks to the likes of Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. The specifics of the Dubai deal aside, there are signs that our preferred way to meet the challenge of a globalized economy is not to innovate and compete but to erect walls, invoke sovereign rights and bury our heads in the sand.</p>              <p>Having committed ourselves to a system and crafted its rules, we are suddenly confronted with the possibility of real competition, whether from China, India or the emirates of the Gulf. There is a debate to be had about the perils and promises of globalization, but invoking national security to block corporate sales or instituting retaliatory tariffs risks eroding both our global leadership and our economic growth. In the coming months there will be calls to label China a ""currency manipulator,"" which may satisfy domestic discontent with the trade deficit but is unlikely to strengthen our economy or enhance our security. In the quid pro quo of international politics, other nations are likely to retaliate the only way they can: by making it more difficult and costly for U.S. companies to operate within their borders.</p>              <p>The concerns over national security and port security are vital and real but should not be conflated with foreign ownership or Arab ownership. Doing so undermines both our ability to craft effective security policies and the global economic system we have spent decades trying to create. The real national security question is not who owns the ports, but how to ensure that they are safe and secure. Period. The economic question is also simple: Do we really want a world where capital and goods flows freely, trade barriers are minimal, and companies can operate on a global scale? Or, do we only want that when it is convenient and comfortable? Nothing the U.S. government can do is likely to halt globalization, but in the process of trying we might unwittingly make the U.S. less competitive, more isolated -- and ultimately less secure.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Mr. Karabell is senior vice president and senior economic analyst at Fred Alger Management.

There was great fear that they would end up controlling the U.S., as well as a public outcry not to let them buy a symbol of New York and America. It turned out that it was a good sale for the American owners. Now we have a Chinese company talking about (to some, threatening) to purchase Unocal. There is an outcry that a foreign company will control one of our energy producers, potentially driving up the price of oil and starting an insidious invasion of our energy supply. Many forget that several U.S. companies have made large investments in China -- often much bigger than the $18.5 billion proposed by the China National Offshore Oil Company.</p>              <p>Chevron worries that if the deal is completed with Cnooc, oil might come off the international market and go directly to China. In their view it would raise the price for other oil on the U.S. and international markets. I can understand Chevron's position, but it is not entirely objective. I share its other concern that competing against Cnooc is unfair because the Chinese government would be subsidizing the bid through zero-interest bearing bonds. But U.S. businesses face difficult subsidized competition around the world, including Italy's steel industry and, of course, Airbus, subsidized by much of Europe.</p>              <p>The price of oil is being driven up significantly by surging global demand led by China and India. China is now the no. 2 user and importer of oil, second only to the U.S. However, this proposed purchase of Unocal by Cnooc should not be alarming. Unocal is a midsized oil and gas exploration and production company, about the same significance as Devon, Burlington, Apache, Anadarko and others. Compared to Exxon, BP, Shell Total and Chevron, it is a small player. Unocal's control of world oil supply is clearly de minimis. And Unocal is a good fit for Cnooc. It is close to the same size, with good technical personnel, and a higher percentage of its production in Asia.</p>              <p>We have issues of greater importance with China than this proposed transaction. The U.S. is frustrated by China's delay in floating its currency, its lack of forcefulness with North Korea and China's arms buildup. And our trade deficit with China now runs in excess of $160 billion per year (almost a quarter of our huge overall trade deficit). Despite all these issues, we must be extremely careful not to send a signal limiting foreign investment, in general, and Chinese investment, in particular. We are a free-trade nation which overall has worked very well for us. Free trade must be a two-way street.</p>              <p>The Committee on Foreign Investments in the U.S. (CFIUS) may review this transaction should it actually come to fruition. But its prime purpose is to keep out of foreign hands those businesses and technologies which could have a negative impact on national security. It is hard to fit the Cnooc-Unocal deal into that definition.</p>              <p>Many of our leaders, from Alan Greenspan to former cabinet officers from both parties, as well as many in Congress, would join in cautioning us about closing potential trade doors based solely on emotion. We should be particularly sensitive to a country which is not only a major trading partner but has also been relatively open to U.S. investments. China makes us nervous because of its size as well as its 9% annual GDP growth rate. This is even more remarkable because it has 1.3 billion people. They are only beginning to define their ""manifest destiny.""</p>              <p>Returning to the ""Japan, Inc."" analogy. In the '80s, Japan's rate of increase of GDP and exports to the U.S. indicated they could possibly overtake our economy by 2020. Now we see communist China most likely surpassing Japan by 2020. However, I firmly believe the U.S. economy will continue to be the world leader. Let's not move in haste in what could be, and, in my estimation, would be, a counterproductive direction through trade or investment restrictions.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Mr. Mosbacher, chairman of the Mosbacher Energy Company, served as secretary of commerce from 1989-1992.</p>                      "

The move puts the state- controlled Chinese company, known as Chinalco, in a key position: BHP Billiton has been trying to acquire Rio Tinto, and Wednesday unveiled a formal all-stock offer it valued at $147.4 billion that would create a global mining powerhouse.</p>              <p>Alcoa said it was studying the offer, while Chinalco declined to comment.</p>              <p>The joint stake was acquired quietly and at a strategically important time. Chinalco Chairman Xiao Yaqing also made immediate public appearances in London and Melbourne, Australia, where both Rio and BHP are based and traded and where regulators have been watching the takeover effort.</p>              <p>""Really, the timing and execution couldn't have been done better,"" says Michael Komesaroff, managing director of Urandaline Investments, an Australian commodities consultancy. ""I'm surprised and impressed at the way they've gone about it.""</p>              <p>To be sure, the purchase is less ambitious than the attempt by China's Cnooc Ltd. to acquire all of fellow oil company Unocal, an effort that met quick U.S. political resistance. Unocal was instead acquired by Chevron Corp.</p>              <p>Still, the $14.05 billion joint purchase is the largest single deal abroad by a Chinese company to date. It shows a shift away from attempts to acquire full control and instead buy minority stakes, thereby dodging many regulatory issues and helping mute political reaction. Chinalco also isn't asking for board representation, presenting its investment as passive.</p>              <p>Like the scotched Unocal deal, the purchase figures into China's rising interest in natural resources, as it becomes one of the world's biggest consumers of raw materials and as commodity prices rise. Mr. Xiao has said Chinalco isn't interested in a takeover of Rio and could sell its stake to a bidder, but the purchase gives the company a big say in Rio's fate.</p>              <p>The Chinalco acquisition could still encounter resistance, in part because of Chinalco's ownership by the Chinese government. Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, responding to a question about the Chinalco deal Tuesday in Canberra, noted that separate rules apply to investment in Australian assets by a foreign government than to other foreign investors.</p>              <p>Chinalco and Alcoa managed to snap up 9% of Rio by purchasing London-listed shares overnight Thursday, while avoiding leaks that might have alerted the market to their plans and given BHP time to respond.</p>              <p>People familiar with the deal say Chinalco was able to act swiftly -- not always easy for a state-owned company -- meeting deadlines and securing the necessary Chinese approvals. That was particularly crucial in this case because of Wednesday's deadline, imposed by United Kingdom regulators, for BHP to make a complete offer for Rio or walk away.</p>              <p>""We were impressed that putting together this deal was a relatively quick process,"" says a person familiar with the deal. ""It shows the progress that China is making in terms of executing global M&amp;A deals.""</p>              <p>By teaming up with Alcoa, Chinalco could help show the deal was commercially driven and mute suspicions that it was orchestrated by the Chinese government. ""Nobody believes that Alcoa would spend $1.2 billion on a deal like this for anything other than profit motivations,"" says a person close to the situation.</p>              <p>Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and China International Capital Corp., the Chinese investment bank, advised Chinalco.</p>              <p>The deal has thrust Mr. Xiao, the head of both Chinalco and its listed unit, Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. or Chalco, into the international spotlight. At 49 years old, he is relatively young for the head of a Chinese state company, and was among the first generation of Chinese students to enter university after the Cultural Revolution.</p>              <p>An engineer trained at a little-known regional university, Mr. Xiao earned his stripes working in an aluminum factory. He has political clout to match his management skills, as an alternate member of the Communist Party's elite Central Committee, a rank held by few state company executives. He joined Chinalco in 2004, and since then has set his sights on turning Chinalco, already the world's second-largest producer of aluminum, into a diversified global metals company.</p>              <p>The company last year bought Peru Copper Inc. and took control of a Chinese miner. Some analysts believe Chinalco and Alcoa are mostly positioning themselves to snap up some of Rio's aluminum assets if BHP's takeover succeeds, but Chinalco describes the Rio investment as a further step in its diversification.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Rachel Pannett in Canberra, Australia, contributed to this article.</p>              <p><object class=""mstar_link_to_media""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""6""/><param name=""mstar_lm_alignment"" value=""Left""/><param name=""mstar_lm_display_control"" value=""Embed""/><param name=""mstar_lm_pred_equation"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_type"" value=""Illustration""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_id"" value=""1""/></object></p>                      "

Amid an anti-Cnooc campaign in Washington, one person close to Chevron conceded, ""A lot of it is not organized; it came on its own. It's a freebie for every congressman to pile on China.""</p>              <p>Chevron believes that sentiment will work in its favor. The possibility that a Cnooc deal would fail to win quick regulatory approval in Washington makes Chevron's offer more attractive despite its lower price, Chevron Vice Chairman Peter Robertson said yesterday in an interview. ""I think we have the better offer, and I think we'll prevail at the level we're at,"" Mr. Robertson said.</p>              <p>Cnooc, China's biggest offshore oil and natural-gas producer, has used a light touch in public, keeping Chief Executive Fu Chengyu from the U.S. In a news release late last week, its chief financial officer promised that once the facts are known, ""many misimpressions will be corrected.""</p>              <p>Still, in Washington, an army of lobbyists led by Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld, a well-connected Dallas law firm, has yet to stanch opposition to Cnooc.</p>              <p>Friday, the company filed a preliminary notice of its deal with the U.S. foreign-acquisition panel, called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. Seeking a review before Unocal and Cnooc have agreed to final terms is an unusual maneuver, but not without precedent. By law, the committee, known as CFIUS, is required to ask Unocal to submit its views on the matter, though Unocal had no role in Cnooc's initial notice, which consisted mainly of basic information such as annual reports and securities filings. A person close to Cnooc said the filing ""sends a message to the government and to Unocal, that we will do everything we can to get this process started.""</p>              <p>Todd M. Malan, executive director of the Organization for International Investment, a trade group of foreign companies with U.S. subsidiaries, says Cnooc's filing for a CFIUS review is smart strategically. ""They are advancing their cause in a pretty zealous way,"" he says. ""One of the main points that Chevron has been making is that the [CFIUS] process is long and opaque. If Cnooc gets the clock started, that provides some level of certainty.""</p>              <p>But Cnooc's eagerness won't necessarily translate into government action, because the panel alone decides when the review begins. Tony Fratto, a spokesman for the Treasury Department, which runs the committee, has said that ""CFIUS does not provide 'advisory opinions.' "" It begins the process when it views ""a transaction is likely to be successful,"" he said.</p>              <p>Congress, meanwhile, can taint shareholder sentiment by creating the impression of a drawn-out approval process. Thursday, the House of Representatives voted 333-92 to bar the Treasury from using any of its funds to ""recommend approval"" of the sale to Cnooc, which might have little bearing on any CFIUS review, given the bill wouldn't take effect until October, and the matter will be decided by then. A nonbinding resolution, adopted 398-15, expressed concern that such a sale ""would threaten to impair"" national security. Texas Republican Joe Barton said last week he would hold public hearings sometime after the Fourth of July congressional recess.</p>              <p>Against these political head winds, Cnooc will need to win support from the Unocal board and its management. Their blessing will be central to mollifying politicians.</p>              <p>Unocal is now studying Cnooc's all-cash offer, and could decide within the next two weeks, a person familiar with the matter said.</p>              <p>Cnooc does have some current leverage. As a person close to Cnooc points out, it would be difficult for Chevron to win Unocal given that its current bid -- which Friday stood at about $60 a share -- is nearly $6 below Unocal's current trading price of $65.84, and $7 below Cnooc's offer. ""If Chevron doesn't raise its bid, we've got a strong hand,"" this person says.</p>              <p>Of course, some Unocal shareholders will want the best money they can get.</p>              <p>""If we had to vote today, I'm not accepting the Chevron deal,"" because Cnooc is offering considerably more money, says Jason Putnam, an energy analyst with Victory Capital Management Inc., one of the 10 largest Unocal shareholders. ""I'm not as concerned about the Washington risk"" as some are, he says.</p>              <p>Mr. Robertson contends that Chevron has other merits over Cnooc. Chevron has more experience and technology drilling for oil and natural gas in deep-water fields like those Unocal has in the Gulf of Mexico and in Indonesia. ""We will produce more oil and gas from those assets in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico than Unocal would have and than Unocal and Cnooc together can.

China's Zhenhua Oil -- whose parent company is an arms maker against which the U.S. has issued sanctions -- and Cnooc Ltd. have signaled to China's National Development and Reform Commission their interest in bidding for Transmeridian, people familiar with the matter said.</p>              <p>It is unclear whether the interest will result in a bid. Transmeridian Chief Financial Officer Earl McNeil declined to comment.</p>              <p>China's oil consumption is growing rapidly, and stagnant domestic crude output has prompted its state oil companies to seek access to overseas reserves through acquisitions. But Beijing's economic and political clout has intensified concerns in the West that the second- largest energy consumer is using its state companies to lock in resources at the expense of the energy security of Western countries. Cnooc withdrew its $18.5 billion offer for California's Unocal Corp. in 2005 after encountering a critical storm in U.S. Congress, clearing the way for a lower bid from Chevron Corp. to win the auction.</p>              <p>In part as a response to that, China's oil companies have focused on smaller deals, often with less-prominent Western companies that are less likely to draw political fire. China's Citic Group last year agreed to acquire the Kazakh assets of Canada's Nations Energy Co. for $1.91 billion. Two years ago, China National Petroleum Corp. paid $4.18 billion for PetroKazakhstan, a Canadian oil company whose main asset was a field in Kazakhstan.</p>              <p>This year, CNPC, the state-owned parent of PetroChina Co., bought rights to fields in Canada with a view to exploring and developing the technically challenging oil sands there.</p>              <p>""Transmeridian's oil assets in Kazakhstan are extremely interesting because there aren't many oil assets available in the market at present. That's why Chinese companies are prepared to battle each other for them,"" said an official at one of the Chinese companies weighing a bid.</p>              <p>That leaves them circling companies outside the oil-patch establishment that often have shallow financial resources, thinly traded shares or lack a track record in developing new resources.</p>              <p>Transmeridian has a 100% interest in CaspiNeft, which holds the license to the South Alibek field in western Kazakhstan. The field had total proved reserves of 67.2 million barrels of oil at the end of 2006. On its Web site, Transmeridian valued the field at $970 million.</p>              <p>But the company and the property face challenges. Transmeridian has been selling its oil at well below world-market prices. Last year, when light, sweet crude was trading at roughly $60 to $70 a barrel, the company's crude fetched an average price of about $34 a barrel. In its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company blamed its need to ship oil via rail or sell oil direct from the field, and said it started to export oil via pipeline on better terms this year.</p>              <p>The company is also working under a significant amount of debt. It has about $268 million in long-term debt due in 2010, according to its annual SEC filing, stemming mostly from privately sold debt that it says carries restrictions on whether it can sell assets or make other corporate moves. Another SEC filing this month showed that Transmeridian had a net working capital deficit of $15.6 million at the end of June. Last year, it reported a net loss of $53.2 million.</p>              <p>Its volatile shares have lost most of their value so far this year, and at 4 p.m. yesterday were trading at $1.87, compared with a 52-week high of $5.18 reached Aug. 31, 2006. It has a market capitalization of $189 million. Its capital structure includes convertible preferred stock that could significantly add to shares outstanding.</p>              <p>Despite the numbers, speculation has swirled in Asia, where both China and India are looking for deals to add to oil reserves. In July, the chairman of India's Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corp., R.S. Sharma, declined to confirm media reports that its ONGC Videsh Ltd. unit was interested in Transmeridian.</p>              <p>Transmeridian effectively put itself up for sale in April when it announced a strategic review of its assets while retaining Jefferies Randall &amp; Dewey, a unit of Jefferies &amp; Co., as its financial adviser. Jefferies declined to comment.</p>              <p>Disclosing the decision to evaluate the company's strategic alternatives in April, Transmeridian President and Chief Executive Lorrie Olivier said it was because ""the current market value of our common stock does not adequately reflect the value of the company's investment in the South Alibek field.""</p>              <p>Chinese interest is likely to be stimulated by strategic needs, given the proximity of Kazakhstan to China and the likelihood that a 470-mile missing link in the Central Asian country's pipeline network from Kenkiyak to Kumkol will be built so it can connect with an existing cross-border crude pipeline to China.</p>              <p>China's interest in Kazakhstan has spurred a political response there, in a time when oil-rich nations are taking a greater say in the ownership and terms of developing reserves within their borders. China's recent deals there spurred the Kazakh government to change the law to allow it to step into any deal concerning the transfer and sale of assets involved in mineral production, with state oil company KazMunaiGaz usually taking as much as 50% of the assets.</p>              <p>It is unlikely that China's oil companies would go head-to-head in bidding for Transmeridian. The National Development and Reform Commission, China's economic-planning agency, discourages domestic companies from competing for foreign assets, because it drives asset prices up and exposes the companies to the risk of overpaying. Transmeridian has said proposals for its acquisition are expected in early September.</p>              <p>Zhenhua, a state-owned oil trader that already has some assets in Kazakhstan, lodged its interest with the NDRC before Chinese rivals, although the NDRC has asked it to work with its rivals to construct a bid consortium, the people said. Zhenhua is an oil trader whose parent is state-owned arms maker China North Industries Group Co., known as Norinco, a major supplier to the People's Liberation Army of China.</p>              <p>Norinco had sanctions imposed on it twice in 2003 by the U.S. government for allegedly selling missile technology to Iran. Norinco says the sanctions are ""unreasonable.""</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Renya Peng in Beijing and John M.

"239","2006-02-13","Whirlpool Faces Antitrust Fight on Maytag Deal; Justice Agency Weighs Case To Bar Tie-Up Amid Worry Over Increased Pricing Clout","399028504","Wall Street Journal","A.3","            >                                        >                          <p>Federal antitrust enforcers are preparing a possible court challenge to Whirlpool Corp.'s $1.7 billion acquisition of competitor Maytag Corp. to prevent the combined companies from dominating the home- appliance market.</p>              <p>Senior Justice Department officials haven't decided to bring a case, and the deal still could be cleared. But after a seven-month investigation, the Justice Department has begun to seek sworn statements from competitors and customers to prepare a request for a court injunction to block the merger, people close to the case said.</p>              <p>Maytag shares have fallen in recent days, losing 3.1% of their value on Friday to close at $16.21. That is well below the $21 in cash-and- stock price that Whirlpool said it would pay last summer for the 103- year-old Newton, Iowa, appliance maker. A spread that large suggests some investors are worried the deal won't be completed.</p>              <p>Maytag didn't return requests for comment. A Whirlpool spokesman declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment.</p>              <p>The deal has been seen as a bellwether for antitrust enforcement by the Bush administration, which has challenged few mergers since it took office in 2001. Combining Whirlpool and Maytag would create a market giant producing half of the nation's dishwashers and more than 70% of clothes washers and dryers.</p>              <p>Under longstanding federal guidelines, such a rise in market concentration would usually draw a court challenge. But Thomas Barnett, the Justice Department's antitrust chief, hasn't yet decided the matter, these people said. As acting chief, he had been the target of a campaign by corporate lobbyists to back off on merger enforcement, and a Senate vote on his nomination was stalled for months. He was confirmed late Friday.</p>              <p>While some corporate interests say the Justice Department has been too tough in reviewing mergers, consumer groups have contended the opposite. The Justice Department approved two giant telecommunications mergers -- the purchase of AT&amp;T Corp. by SBC Communications Inc., now AT&amp;T Inc., and Verizon Communications Inc.'s acquisition of MCI -- with no conditions despite concerns expressed by consumer groups and others that it would lead to higher prices for customers.</p>              <p>Whirlpool won a merger agreement from Maytag in July, after outbidding two other suitors, including a friendly takeover proposal by Qingdao Haier Co. Ltd., China's largest appliance maker. Whirlpool and Maytag agreed to delay closing the deal until Feb. 27, to give the Justice Department time to complete its investigation.</p>              <p>Even when the Whirlpool deal was first proposed, shareholder advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services said the combination had a 50% chance of closing. But under pressure from investors, Maytag spurned a $14-per-share bid from private-equity fund Ripplewood Holdings LLC for Whirlpool's $21-per-share offer.</p>              <p>It is not uncommon for the Justice Department to begin building a case against a deal even as it is working out a settlement with the merging parties. A settlement could include divestiture of certain product lines or perhaps a spinoff of those lines. Such remedies could substantially change the overall value of the deal.</p>              <p>Whirlpool and Maytag have said they are cooperating with the government, and that the merger should be approved to create a stronger competitor against international competition, especially from China.</p>              <p>But Justice Department staff has been skeptical of this argument and has tentatively concluded that any economic efficiencies claimed by the companies are outweighed by their ability to raise consumer prices if the deal were to proceed, the people close to the review said.</p>              <p>In addition to the Whirlpool and KitchenAid brands, the Benton Harbor, Mich., manufacturer supplies washers and dryers to Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., part of Sears Holdings Corp., under the Kenmore brand, which is a factor in the antitrust review. For 2005, Whirlpool had net income of $422 million on revenue of $14.32 billion. It has 68,000 employees.</p>              <p>Maytag had a net loss of $81.9 million and revenue of $4.9 billion for 2005. It owns the Jenn-Air, Amana and Hoover brands. The company said it might try to sell the Hoover vacuum-cleaner unit and a smaller vending-machine product line.</p>              <p>Most companies drop merger plans once it becomes clear they will be opposed by the Justice Department. But Whirlpool could choose to fight the case in court, perhaps emboldened by the Justice Department's loss last year in a challenge of Oracle Corp.'s buyout of PeopleSoft Corp. And even if it loses, Whirlpool will have effectively sidelined its largest rival for a year or more.</p>              <p>The Whirlpool contract offers little protection to Maytag if antitrust concerns prevail. If divestitures are required, Whirlpool's contract allows it to rewrite or drop the deal, potentially leaving Maytag with only a $120 million ""reverse-breakup fee."" That would probably represent just a small portion of the drop in Maytag's value should the deal unravel.</p>              <p>If the deal falls apart, that could open the door for a renewed bid from Ripplewood, which had originally tabled a $14-per-share offer for the company. Though it didn't budge from that level, it could sweeten the offer.</p>              <p>There also is potential that Chinese firm Qingdao Haier could step back into the mix, aided by the private-equity funds that helped back its original effort. Haier had offered $16 per share, but abandoned its bid as Whirlpool grew more serious.</p>                      "

Chevron also will add to its Gulf of Mexico and Caspian Sea holdings.</p>              <p>According to a preliminary tally, slightly more than three-quarters of Unocal shares were voted to accept Chevron's offer of about $66.21 a share. The merger was expected to be completed by late yesterday.</p>              <p>Chevron surprised some oil-industry observers by aggressively pursuing Unocal at a time when oil prices were near records. Officials at the San Ramon, Calif., company have argued they paid a fair price for energy assets in what has been a frothy mergers-and-acquisitions market. Now it is up to Chevron to integrate the companies' operations and find ways to increase Unocal's known reserves of oil and gas to get a good return on its investment.</p>              <p>Chevron Chairman and Chief Executive David O'Reilly said in an interview yesterday that he pursued Unocal because the deal ""offers good value for our shareholders."" He said he bid for Unocal, when no other Western oil company was willing, because Unocal's global assets dovetail with Chevron's assets. ""We have more synergy in terms of overlapping of operations than any other company. That makes it more valuable to us,"" he said.</p>              <p>Still, whether the deal ultimately is viewed as a coup or as an ill- advised purchase will depend largely on whether oil and gas prices stay high or decline in the next few years.</p>              <p>The deal wrapped up as oil was topping $65 a barrel, setting a record for trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Mr. O'Reilly, a believer that there has been a permanent upward shift in oil prices, said these prices surprise even him. He said he expects such high- priced oil will spur increased capital investment and moderate demand growth. ""I'm not sure when that will happen; it may take past this winter for it to happen, but I just don't see $60 oil for an extended period of time,"" he said.</p>              <p>Chevron stock slid 4% the day the deal was announced in April, though it ultimately rebounded as oil prices surged. Its share price is now up 5% since its premerger announcement level before Unocal tentatively accepted Chevron's bid on April 4. Chevron officials have said they believe their company's stock value will increase now that the uncertainty of the deal is behind them.</p>              <p>Unocal shareholders had a choice of receiving cash, Chevron stock or a mix, although ultimately Chevron will pay 40% cash and 60% stock for Unocal. The cash offer was worth 8% more than the stock offer, so a large majority of Unocal shareholders opted for cash, according to a preliminary tally.</p>              <p>The vote closes the book on the 115-year-old Unocal, once known as Union Oil Co. of California and perhaps best known for its string of ""76"" gas stations that it sold in 1997 to Tosco Corp., now part of ConocoPhillips. For the past few years, Unocal, which was the ninth- largest U.S. oil company by reserves, was a pure exploration-and- production company, with about half of its assets in North America and the rest in Asia.Last week, China's Cnooc Ltd. abandoned its all-cash $67-a-share bid, citing ""unprecedented political opposition"" in the U.S., paving the way for Chevron to acquire Unocal. The two jockeyed for Unocal for weeks after Cnooc lobbed in an $18.5 billion bid in June, topping Chevron's offer. Cnooc later offered to increase its bid 3%, but sought to enlist Unocal's help lobbying Congress. Unocal declined, citing its merger agreement with Chevron. Still, Chevron felt threatened enough to sweeten its bid on July 19.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Online Today: Chevron CEO David O'Reilly discusses the Unocal deal, whether Chevron overpaid and the company's ""replacement rate.""

But this issue hasn't hindered the company's rapid growth elsewhere.</p>              <p>The Shenzhen, China-based telecommunications-equipment company offered no public statement yesterday on the withdrawal of an application to the U.S. government for approval of its joint $2.2 billion purchase, with Bain Capital LLC, of 3Com Corp. of the U.S.</p>              <p>The three companies on Wednesday withdrew the application from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. amid expectations that CFIUS was likely to deny approval of the deal because of Huawei's role, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>              <p>Founded in 1988, Huawei has grown rapidly to become a major competitor to established network-equipment vendors like Alcatel- Lucent and Cisco Systems Inc. But the Chinese company's spotty transparency, and the military roots of its founder, have continued to fuel suspicion that it is closely tied to the Chinese government -- suspicions the company, and some analysts, have said are unfounded.</p>              <p>The U.S. is one of the few markets in the world where Huawei has run into such political problems. Generally, despite its image as a national champion in China, Huawei's growth has come largely from foreign markets. Huawei claims sales in more than 100 countries, and says it is an equipment provider to 35 of the world's 50 biggest telecom carriers. Its ""contract sales"" -- a measure of orders that generally approximates its revenue for the next year -- soared 45% last year to about $16 billion from $11 billion in 2006, the company said; about $11.5 billion came from outside China.</p>              <p>Some worry that Huawei's rejection could set back efforts for Chinese companies to expand their reach abroad -- particularly in the U.S. -- similar to what happened after state-owned oil company Cnooc Ltd. ran into a firestorm when it tried to buy Unocal Corp. in 2005. Since then, Chinese companies have generally sought partners and minority stakes in making investments, and over the past year, an increasing number of financial investments have generally been accepted without a political backlash.</p>              <p>Under the September agreement, Huawei would have held a passive 16.5% stake in 3Com, which makes telecom and computer gear and also supplies the U.S. government with some security software. Boston-based Bain would have owned the rest. But critics in the U.S. have raised concerns that Huawei's involvement could have jeopardized national security. The withdrawal Wednesday of the CFIUS application likely torpedoes a deal.</p>              <p>China's government issued a restrained response yesterday. The Huawei deal ""should be considered a normal one in the market economy"" and ""driven by the requirements of the company's development,"" Liu Jianchao, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told a routine news conference. ""We hope that the relevant U.S. regulatory agencies will handle the issue fairly.""</p>              <p>Huawei isn't publicly listed, so it isn't subject to disclosure requirements of China's stock exchanges. In its most recent annual report, it reported that revenue grew 42% in 2006 to $8.5 billion, while net profit shrank 25% to $512 million.</p>              <p>But Huawei offers few other details on its finances, and it has given scant information about its ownership, other than to say it is owned by its employees, including founder and head Ren Zhengfei, a former People's Liberation Army officer.</p>              <p>A 2005 report by Rand Corp., a U.S.-based think tank, alleged that Huawei ""maintains deep ties with the Chinese military, which serves a multifaceted role as an important customer, as well as Huawei's political patron and research and development partner.""</p>              <p>Huawei didn't respond yesterday to requests for comment made directly and through its outside public-relations firms.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Andrew Batson contributed to this article.</p>              <p><object class=""mstar_link_to_media""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""6""/><param name=""mstar_lm_alignment"" value=""Left""/><param name=""mstar_lm_display_control"" value=""Embed""/><param name=""mstar_lm_pred_equation"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_type"" value=""Illustration""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_id"" value=""1""/></object></p>                      "

""3Com has been on one of the industry's longest death spirals,"" he said.</p>              <p>The 3Com deal reflects a burgeoning trend for Chinese companies: engaging in overseas mergers and acquisitions by purchasing strategic stakes instead of complete corporate control. By leaving majority control to others, the Chinese companies hope they can help mitigate political concerns that have sunk big Chinese takeover attempts before, most notably Cnooc Ltd.'s failed bid in 2005 for Unocal Corp.</p>              <p>Such political concerns are especially significant in the telecom industry, given the advanced technology involved. And the 3Com transaction is expected to get a thorough vetting in Washington, where federal officials are wary of foreign access to U.S. telecom and networking infrastructure.</p>              <p>Huawei has grown quickly since it was founded in 1988 by Ren Zhengfei, a former Chinese army officer and the company's current chief executive. The closely held company, which doesn't publicly report complete financial data, now claims some 62,000 employees and says its sales rose 45% last year to 65.6 billion yuan ($8.73 billion) from 45.3 billion yuan in 2005.</p>              <p>The buyout also shows some openness in the credit markets, which for the past two months have been nearly shut to private-equity firms looking for deals.</p>              <p>The 3Com acquisition is the biggest U.S. private-equity deal since Cerberus Capital Management agreed to buy United Rentals Inc. on July 23, according to data compiled by Thomson Financial.</p>              <p>But deal makers shouldn't start jumping for joy just yet. Aspects of the 3Com deal made it easier for Bain to get banks to fund the deal. The debt that will be raised to fund it will be backed by H3C Technologies, 3Com's Chinese networking business, people familiar with the matter said. The unit, which until last year was a joint venture with Huawei, forms the bulk of the value of 3Com, analysts say.</p>              <p>It also helped that the total debt only amounts to four times cash flow, according to people close to the deal. In addition, the buyers are putting up more than half of the purchase price, much higher than the typical private-equity deal.</p>              <p>Structuring the loan financing that way helped get the deal done because credit markets in Asia haven't been as hard hit as they have been in the U.S. and Europe. Among the usual lineup of Citigroup Inc., UBS AG, HSBC Holdings PLC and ABN Amro Holding NV, is Bank of China.</p>              <p>Cisco Systems Inc. supplanted 3Com, an early networking pioneer, in the 1990s as the dominant player in the industry. Besides competition, 3Com ran into problems that included the purchase of modem maker U.S. Robotics Corp. in 1997 for $6.6 billion and the later bust that followed the Internet boom.</p>              <p>Under former CEO Bruce Claflin, 3Com moved from Silicon Valley to Marlborough, Mass., and reached deals that included the 2004 acquisition of computer-security firm TippingPoint Technologies Inc., for $430 million. On Friday, 3Com -- whose current chief executive is Edgar Masri -- said it will continue with its plans to offer shares in the unit to the public.</p>              <p>The 3Com deal is the latest in a string of acquisitions of telecom- equipment companies, as the industry experiences an echo of the consolidation of service providers such as AT&amp;T Inc. that form the cornerstone if its customer base. In 2006, Alcatel SA of France and Lucent Technologies Inc. of the U.S. finalized a merger largely driven by cost-cutting.</p>              <p>Huawei was crucial to Bain securing 3Com. That is because the Chinese company has a noncompete agreement with 3Com, stemming from the previous joint venture. That deals lapses in 2008. Should the buyer have been a company such as Nortel Networks Corp. -- which was involved in the auction, people close to the deal say -- it would have faced competition from Huawei in short order. That would be a daunting prospect given that Huawei is also an H3C customer, responsible for 30% of its revenue.</p>              <p><object class=""mstar_link_to_media""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""6""/><param name=""mstar_lm_alignment"" value=""Left""/><param name=""mstar_lm_display_control"" value=""Embed""/><param name=""mstar_lm_pred_equation"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_type"" value=""Illustration""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_id"" value=""1""/></object></p>                      "
"244","2007-08-28","Acer Buys Gateway, Bulks Up for Global Fight","399056683","Wall Street Journal","B.1","            >                                        >                          <p>The banding together of Taiwan-based personal-computer maker Acer Inc. and Gateway Inc. of the U.S. underlines how crucial scale is in the consolidating global personal-computer market, where margins are thin and competition is increasing.</p>              <p>Acer's latest push into the U.S. also marks a new stage in one of the PC industry's biggest turnaround stories.</p>              <p>Acer yesterday announced its $710 million acquisition of Irvine, Calif.-based Gateway, vaulting the combined company into the No. 3 spot in global PC-market share by unit shipments. The new Acer would supplant China's Lenovo Group Ltd., which rose to the third spot in the industry two years ago by purchasing the PC operations of International Business Machines Corp.</p>              <p>""Scale is important and will become even more important in the future,"" Gianfranco Lanci, president of Acer, said in an interview. He added that for the time being, he planned to consolidate Gateway's supply chain into Acer's to gain efficiencies but keep Gateway running as a separate company.</p>              <p>""This transaction provides the scale to compete in today's global market,"" Acer Chairman J.T. Wang said on a conference call.</p>              <p>PC companies have their components built by suppliers that discount their prices based on the size of an order. Now, Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Inc., which together accounted for more than 52% of the U.S. PC market in 2006, can put in the biggest orders and get the biggest discounts. They then often use such discounts to underprice their competition, which helps maintain or increase their share. The vicious cycle makes it nearly impossible for smaller PC players to compete profitably.</p>              <p>While Gateway and Acer were respectably sized, their market shares were tiny compared with H-P and Dell. Together, however, the combined company would have had revenue of more than $15 billion for 2006, and it expects to ship about 25 million PCs this year, executives said. Acer executives said they will continue to use the Gateway and eMachine brand names after the acquisition.</p>              <p>Mr. Wang acknowledged the multibrand move is a ""major change in corporate strategy"" for single-brand Acer, but he said it would be a strength to have three brands as it would enable the company to better target different segments of the consumer market. Mr. Lanci added, ""The other good reason is that the Gateway brand is a very well- recognized brand in the U.S., and we want to continue to leverage on the brand in the U.S. and to expand [it] outside the U.S., because we see opportunity in some emerging countries in Asia.""</p>              <p>Acer executives said they expect the union to save the combined company about $150 million next year, by giving it better purchasing power for components and by cost cuts through combining parts of overlapping operations like customer services. Gateway is in talks to sell its unit that sells PCs to education, government and businesses, the company has said.</p>              <p>Under the terms of the deal, Acer will launch a cash tender offer for all outstanding shares of Gateway for $1.90 a share, a 57% premium to the closing price of Gateway's shares on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. Yesterday, Gateway's shares rose 61 cents to $1.82. The companies said the deal was approved unanimously by the boards of both companies and is expected to close by December.</p>              <p>Acer has been plotting an acquisition for about a year. Mr. Wang first disclosed the company's intention to do a deal in March, though he didn't specify any possible targets. Monday he said Acer and Gateway have been in contact for some time but that serious discussions about the deal began about six weeks ago.</p>              <p>Gateway decided to sell itself when its board determined that a combined Acer-Gateway would benefit from greater scale and efficiencies, making it more competitive, said a person familiar with the matter. The once highflying PC maker, known for boxes with a cow- hide print, referring to the company's 1985 founding by Ted Waitt in an Iowa farmhouse, had in recent years been buffeted by stiff competition and declining sales. Its purchase once again narrows the ranks of U.S. PC manufacturers, which once included powerhouses such as Compaq Computer Corp. Nevertheless, the U.S. still has the world's two biggest makers, Hewlett-Packard and Dell.</p>              <p>For Acer, a company that once made PCs for big-name Western brands and is now buying one, the purchase marks a major -- though potentially risky -- step. Owning Gateway, which has roughly 1,645 employees, will dramatically increase Acer's foothold in the U.S., a market long dominated by Dell and H-P but where Acer has been making some headway selling its laptop PCs through big retail chains like Best Buy Co.</p>              <p>That's a contrast to the mid-1990s, when Acer tried to grab market share in the U.S. before effectively retreating in 1999. Later, Acer's chairman, Mr. Wang, jokingly called the U.S. the company's ""land of sorrow."" Acer has since recovered and successfully pushed into Europe, where it is a dominant seller.</p>              <p>But while a combined Acer and Gateway would hold about a 10.8% share of the U.S. PC market, it still remains far smaller than H-P and Dell. In the second quarter of this year, H-P had a 23.6% share of the U.S. PC market, while Dell had 28.4%. Overall, a combined Acer and Gateway would have about 9% of the global PC market, compared with H-P's 19.2% and Dell's 16.1%, according to IDC.</p>              <p>If the deal goes through, managing three different brands could increase the complexity of Acer's operations. Retailers may want to condense the shelf space they allot to the brands, for example, now that they're all owned by one company.</p>              <p>The new tie-up could also strike a blow to China's Lenovo, which in 2005 acquired IBM's PC business and this year has been battling with Acer for the industry's No. 3 spot.</p>              <p>Earlier this month, Lenovo disclosed that it was in talks to buy a stake in Packard Bell BV, a Netherlands-based PC maker. But in a separate statement issued yesterday, Gateway appeared to throw cold water on those talks, saying it intends to exercise a ""right of first refusal"" to acquire all the shares in Packard Bell's parent company, PB Holding Co. Gateway said it had acquired that right in June 2006 from John Hui, the Chinese-American businessman who owns Packard Bell.</p>              <p>Gateway said it had recently received a notice from Mr. Hui offering to sell all the shares of Packard Bell's parent to Gateway. It's unclear what the price would be.</p>              <p>Lenovo says it remains interested in acquiring Packard Bell. A Packard Bell spokesperson didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>              <p>Many analysts said they weren't surprised Gateway is being acquired. The PC maker hit its peak in the late 1990s with its quirky cow logo and Gateway Country retail stores. However, it suffered when competitors such as Dell priced their wares more cheaply. In 2002, Gateway expanded into consumer electronics such as flat-screen TVs, but the efforts didn't bolster its sagging PC business. By 2004, it had closed its stores and refocused on PCs. Its stock price, which once hit $82.50, has fallen around 98% to its current level.</p>              <p>It's unclear who will manage the Gateway business and what happens to current Chief Executive Ed Coleman, says a person familiar with the matter.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Loretta Chao and Jane Spencer contributed to this article.</p>              <p><object class=""mstar_link_to_media""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""6""/><param name=""mstar_lm_alignment"" value=""Left""/><param name=""mstar_lm_display_control"" value=""Embed""/><param name=""mstar_lm_pred_equation"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_type"" value=""Illustration""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_id"" value=""1""/></object></p>              <p><object class=""mstar_link_to_media""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""6""/><param name=""mstar_lm_alignment"" value=""Left""/><param name=""mstar_lm_display_control"" value=""Embed""/><param name=""mstar_lm_pred_equation"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_type"" value=""Illustration""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_id"" value=""2""/></object></p>                      "

The decision signaled the government likely wouldn't have approved the deal, according to people familiar with the matter, fearing that Huawei's influence could put government secrets at risk.</p>              <p>The company makes telecommunications and computer gear and supplies the U.S. government with some security software. Under the deal, Huawei would have held a passive 16.5% stake in 3Com, with Boston- based Bain owning the rest.</p>              <p>The reverberations of the decision could be significant for deal makers, who are increasingly reliant on foreign capital for acquisitions as the debt-fueled buyout cycle has petered out. U.S. authorities have allowed banks, including Citigroup Inc. and Bear Stearns Cos., to accept billions of dollars in Chinese and other foreign funds to help shore up their balance sheets in the wake of the credit crisis. But the rejection of the 3Com transaction is a clear rebuke of Chinese designs on U.S. technology companies in some sensitive industries.</p>              <p>""There will be tremendous repercussions in China because of this,"" said Dan Harris, a Seattle lawyer who represents U.S. clients in China. ""We should not be ignoring the impact that this might have on our own companies trying to do business over there.""</p>              <p>Had it succeeded, the deal could have served as a blueprint for similar transactions by Chinese companies. And a successful deal would have bolstered Bain's reputation in China, where cash-rich companies are eager to find a partner for investing in the U.S.</p>              <p>The deal didn't fall apart as a result of the credit crisis. It was relatively small and featured significant underwriting from Asian banks, which are less exposed to the credit pressures in the U.S. and Europe.</p>              <p>The real pushback came from Washington, where the deal faced sharpened scrutiny over concerns about Huawei's ties to the Chinese government. Worries grew within the Bush administration, especially among security officials with a role in CFIUS. The proposed deal was given elevated attention and put through a 45-day investigation, beyond the standard 30-day review conducted by CFIUS.</p>              <p>Bain and Huawei said they would be willing to sell the 3Com unit that handles the government security contracts, but that wasn't enough to assuage the committee's concerns.</p>              <p>In a reflection of the tensions, a number of lawmakers on Capitol Hill stepped forward to voice alarm, most notably Michigan Rep. John Dingell, chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee.</p>              <p>Mr. Dingell and Texas Rep. Joe Barton, the panel's senior Republican, put the White House on notice of the House committee's intention to probe the deal, a move that could have opened the door to an election-year debate about the economic competition posed by China and public concerns about globalization. Deals that raise national- security concerns are subject to review by CFIUS, which is led by the administration; this would have been a House-committee probe. In a letter sent to the administration in early February, the lawmakers said there was a ""growing apprehension"" in Congress about the wisdom of going forward with the transaction.</p>              <p>According to people familiar with the matter, the companies involved couldn't come to terms with the Bush administration on the details of a so-called mitigation agreement, which is meant to satisfy the government's security concerns. The request for CFIUS approval of the deal was pulled toward the end of the panel's 45-day investigation, individuals familiar with the matter said.</p>              <p>Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican, welcomed the decision by the companies to back away from the merger. He said the proposed transaction ""was a bad deal for American security,"" but also a harbinger of challenges facing the government, as China, awash in capital, continues to look to the U.S. for acquisition opportunities.</p>              <p>""China has lots of cash. American companies are in need of cash,"" Mr. Hunter said. ""There's going to be a continuing conflict, between American security interest and the desire for ready cash. You're going to see this more and more.""</p>              <p>China's record in investing in big U.S. assets has been spotty. International Business Machines Corp. succeeded in selling its personal-computer business to Lenovo Group Ltd. for $1.75 billion in 2004. But a year later, political concerns killed an attempt by the state-owned China National Offshore Oil Company Ltd. to acquire Unocal Corp.</p>              <p>Treasury Department spokeswoman Brookly McLaughlin said the Bush administration ""welcomes investment from all over the world.""</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Peter Lattman contributed to this article.</p>                      "

A copy of the document was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>              <p>CICC and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.</p>              <p>Bidders submitted nonbinding indicative offers for the stake early this month, and due diligence for a short-listed set of bidders is expected to get under way soon.</p>              <p>The original phantom-share program was designed to give CICC's management an incentive to pursue an initial public offering, according to a person familiar with the situation. The plan was for the phantom shares to be converted into ordinary shares as part of an IPO that would give other shareholders a chance to sell their original holdings at a profit.</p>              <p>The incentive didn't work. While CICC's board was eager to pursue a listing, management dragged its feet on setting an IPO timetable, a person familiar with the situation said. This person says top managers worried that going public would force them to disclose compensation of senior employees and subject their decisions to the supervision of minority shareholders.</p>              <p>CICC's staff, particularly its senior management, are well paid in a country where many executives at state-owned firms earn civil-servant salaries. CICC paid its employees $434.9 million in 2007 including salaries, bonuses, housing allowances and other expenses. That compares with $869.2 million in total revenue. Total compensation fell to $282.5 million in 2008 as revenues decreased to $587.9 million.</p>              <p>CICC's compensation, including the phantom-share program, is sensitive because it raises the issue of whether the bank's management, led by Chief Executive Levin Zhu, is benefiting too much from its stewardship of a state asset. Employees of investment banks world-wide typically receive a portion of their payout in the form of shares.</p>              <p>What is different in CICC's case is that the Chinese government owns a majority stake in the firm and Chinese state firms pay much of its income. CICC's chief executive is the son of former Chinese premier Zhu Rongji, a key figure in the reform of China's state-owned firms. CICC is majority-owned by two Chinese state-owned companies, including a unit of China Investment Corp., the nation's sovereign-wealth fund, which holds 43.35% of the company's ordinary shares. Sovereign-wealth fund Government of Singapore Investment Corp. and Hong Kong's Mingly Corp. each own a 7.35% stake.</p>              <p>The phantom-share program was supposed to end with the IPO. When the IPO didn't materialize by the end of 2006, the program was extended ""in order to help retain talent and better align incentives,"" according to the Morgan Stanley sale document. Employees that leave the firm sell their phantom shares back to the company at book value and those shares are granted to other employees. The overall amount of phantom shares remains constant.</p>              <p>But CICC's management wasn't happy with that. When Morgan Stanley attempted to sell its CICC stake in late 2007 and early 2008, CICC managers told bidders that they wanted new phantom shares to be granted to employees, according to people familiar with the situation, giving them a bigger economic interest in the firm.</p>              <p>Another person familiar with the situation said CICC Chairman Li Jiange, appointed in July 2008, has worked hard to resolve the tension and tried to offer increased compensation to management. It is unclear what CICC's management's current position is on more phantom shares and how CICC's board has adjusted compensation policies.</p>              <p><object class=""mstar_link_to_media""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""6""/><param name=""mstar_lm_alignment"" value=""Left""/><param name=""mstar_lm_display_control"" value=""Embed""/><param name=""mstar_lm_pred_equation"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_type"" value=""Illustration""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_id"" value=""1""/></object></p>              <p>Credit: By Rick Carew</p>                      "

These people described the talks as being at a sensitive stage, and said they might not produce a deal.</p>              <p>An AES spokeswoman declined to comment. A spokeswoman for CIC also declined to comment.</p>              <p>CIC's interest in AES reflects China's growing appetite for diversifying its $2 trillion in foreign-currency reserves. Lately CIC and other Chinese state-controlled companies have been purchasing assets around the world, including oil-and-gas producers, stakes in U.S. financial companies Blackstone Group LP and Morgan Stanley and a large position in Canadian miner Teck Resources Ltd.</p>              <p>A deal with AES would demonstrate China's increasing comfort with politically sensitive investments. Historically, the U.S. has been leery of any Chinese investments in American infrastructure companies, fearing potential espionage. While CIC and AES are discussing power projects outside the U.S., any agreement would have to withstand U.S. political scrutiny.</p>              <p>In 2005, China created an uproar in the U.S. when a state-owned oil company made a bid for California-based Unocal Corp. But fears in the U.S. and elsewhere about China taking control of major companies have subsided in recent years, largely because tight credit has made both companies and governments eager to gain access to Chinese capital.</p>              <p>AES, a global power-plant developer and utilities operator, is active in 29 countries. About two-thirds of its investments are in the power-generation business and one third in utilities. It owns 14 utilities that serve 11 million customers, including customers in Indianapolis. It also has power facilities in New York, Texas, and California.</p>              <p>AES's earnings growth is largely driven by its construction program, as projects are completed and begin producing cash. Earlier in the decade it was considered a hot stock and traded for $50 to $70 a share. But the company suffered as Enron Corp.'s collapse prompted investors to pull back from power-plant developers and credit got tight.</p>              <p>For the most part, AES's stock has traded at less than $20 since 2002, though it slipped to less than $5 earlier this year amid the recession. In 4 p.m. composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, AES shares were up 1 cent at $14.15.</p>              <p>Although it has a significant power-plant development business, AES has had little presence in one of the fastest-growing markets -- China. It has about 200 megawatts of wind-generating capacity under construction there now, half-owned by a Chinese partner, Guohua Energy.</p>              <p>China is especially alluring because many other nations, including the U.S., are experiencing declining electricity demand, while demand in China is still growing.

Flowers?</p>              <p>The buyout firm, headed by former Goldman Sachs Group star J. Christopher Flowers, has flirted with nearly every big financial- services buyout from SLM (Sallie Mae) to United Kingdom life insurer Friends Provident. For one reason or another it hasn't yet pulled the trigger on anything big recently. Still, the money keeps pouring in: China's government investment fund, China Investment Corp., recently agreed to start a $4 billion private-equity fund with Flowers to focus on investments in U.S. financial assets.</p>              <p>Flowers's most notable deals include the takeover and cleanup of Shinsei Bank in 2000. But the firm increasingly seems to be defined by opportunities it has walked away from. It jilted student lender Sallie Mae on that $26 billion buyout. Flowers looked like it was in the bidding for Northern Rock, but then pulled out. And now it looks like it might walk away from a GBP 3.5 billion ($7 billion) takeover proposal for Friends Provident.</p>              <p>Is this bad luck? An excess of caution? One person who has worked with Flowers's firm said its partners are among the most cautious he has ever encountered and are tough negotiators.</p>              <p>Now, Flowers has made 13 investments through March from its latest fund, which it raised in 2006.

In one scenario being contemplated in New York, China Investment Corp. would take a significant stake in the combined company.</p>              <p>But one roadblock to a potential deal could be how the federal rescue plan addresses the mortgage portfolio at Wachovia. Other issues could include price and Morgan Stanley's leverage.</p>              <p>A deal isn't a foregone conclusion, especially if shareholders view the firms as more risky together than apart. On Friday, Morgan Stanley shares surged 21%, while Wachovia's jumped 29%.</p>              <p>CIC's interest might be contingent on Wachovia being able to offload some of its mortgage assets. So far, the CIC discussion has been preliminary and hasn't been broached with Wachovia's board.</p>              <p>The situation is particularly fluid because the federal mortgage- bailout plan hasn't been finalized and the latest discussions in Washington may make a deal more difficult to pull off.</p>              <p>If a Wachovia deal doesn't pan out, Morgan might have time to talk to other parties that weren't prepared to proceed unless they could thoroughly analyze the securities firm's books.</p>              <p>Some investors have been pushing for Morgan Stanley to join with a commercial bank like Wachovia that relies on retail deposits for a greater share of its funding. John Mack, Morgan Stanley's chief executive officer, has known Wachovia CEO Robert Steel for many years.</p>              <p>Mr. Mack once discussed with Mr. Steel, a former Goldman Sachs executive and a top Treasury official, the idea of coming to work at Morgan Stanley.</p>              <p>Friday's 13.2% jump by the Dow Jones Wilshire Bank Stock index also gave more breathing room to Washington Mutual Inc., the Seattle thrift that started looking for a possible buyer earlier this past week. If WaMu executives think they can dump some bad mortgages, they might be more reluctant to sell at a low price.</p>              <p>A WaMu spokesman said the company is ""encouraged"" by the government's plan. WaMu shares rose 42%, or $1.26, to $4.25 Friday.</p>              <p>Overall, bankers generally applauded the government's mortgage plan but cautioned that it isn't a panacea. One problem: While home loans are the epicenter of the industry's crisis, troubles are spreading to a much wider range of loans. Default rates on commercial-real-estate loans, for example, are rapidly increasing at banks nationwide.</p>              <p>""This doesn't do anything to interrupt the slide of real-estate prices,"" said John Kanas, who ran regional lender North Fork Bancorp until selling it in 2006.</p>              <p>Bankers hoped the bailout would facilitate capital raising, but some investors said they wouldn't jump into the sector without more details about the government's plans. Bankers also worried about the federal plan to insure money-market funds. Such funds pay higher interest rates than bank accounts, and with government backing, ""they will be in a significantly superior market position,"" said American Bankers Association President Edward Yingling.</p>                      "

Coke might use its dominant position in the carbonated-beverage market to restrict competition in the juice business, the ministry said.</p>              <p>Coca-Cola is the largest seller of carbonated soft drinks in China, with a 52.5% market share, according to research firm Euromonitor. Huiyuan, meanwhile, is China's largest maker of 100%-juice drinks, with a 33% market share. Coke also sells juice drinks, and the two companies' combined share of the fruit-and-vegetable juice market last year was 20.3%, according to Euromonitor.</p>              <p>The ruling -- the first major test of a new antimonopoly law -- sends ""a very negative message,"" said Lester Ross, an attorney in U.S. law firm WilmerHale's Beijing office, who wasn't involved in the deal. ""I think it was driven by protectionism, fueled by popular resentment against a foreign company acquiring a popular Chinese brand.""</p>              <p>Mei Xinyu, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Trade and Economic Cooperation, which is affiliated with the Commerce Ministry, said the ruling had ""nothing to do with trade protectionism.""</p>              <p>The deal did, however, block what would have been the largest-ever takeover of a Chinese company by a foreign buyer.</p>              <p>Merger-and-acquisition lawyers who weren't involved in the deal said the ministry's statement indicates that officials appeared to rely on broader definitions of anticompetitive harm than used by their counterparts in the U.S. The ministry's statement implied that a company's overall size, in addition to its share of any given market, should be taken into account, these lawyers said.</p>              <p>Yi Xianrong, a researcher in the finance and banking section of the government-backed Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, criticized the ministry's rejection, saying it was ""groundless"" given the intense competition in the industry.</p>              <p>Lawyers and bankers said higher antitrust barriers from Beijing could further hinder companies trying to conduct deals and invest in China, where it long has been difficult to acquire assets from state-owned companies. The Finance Ministry on Wednesday announced rules that make it harder for foreign investors in financial-services businesses to buy or sell their stakes. This follows moves by some foreign banks in recent months to sell holdings in Chinese banks.</p>              <p>Meanwhile, perceptions that China is hostile to foreign investors could hurt Chinese companies looking to take advantage of low prices to invest abroad, particularly in oil, metals and other natural resources that Beijing sees as critical to sustaining the nation's economic growth.</p>              <p>The government is looking to loosen those reins further, issuing rules Monday that reduce regulatory hurdles for Chinese companies looking to invest overseas. Last week, China's minister of commerce, Chen Deming, called on the global community to ""jointly oppose trade protectionism."" In the past two years, the value of deals struck by Chinese companies overseas has far exceeded that of deals made by foreign companies in China.</p>              <p>The Commerce Ministry said Wednesday that it had attempted to negotiate with Coca-Cola for a more limited deal that would ease the anticompetitive effects of the acquisition but that the company's response didn't go far enough to address its concerns. Coke didn't comment beyond its prepared statement expressing regret the deal was killed.</p>              <p>Coke's effort to acquire Huiyuan met with public criticism in China. Shortly after the deal was announced, a poll of about a half-million people by Web portal Sina.com showed that nearly 80% of participants opposed the transaction.</p>              <p>Chinese executives also were critical. Yang Xiulin, the marketing director of beverage company Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co. said ""if national brands are gone, for the long term, it's not good for the Chinese industry.""</p>              <p>The roles have been reversed, however. In 2005, state-controlled Cnooc Ltd. attempted to acquire Unocal Corp. of the U.S. for $18.5 billion, only to withdraw within weeks amid intense political pressure in the U.S. While Cnooc's deal-making inexperience contributed to its difficulties, opposition from U.S. lawmakers surprised China and left many in the country believing the U.S. wouldn't stand by its own open-markets rhetoric.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Andrew Batson in Beijing and James T.

But the past decade was unusually tumultuous: Two investment bubbles grew, then burst, each followed by a recession. The Internet matured into a crucial cog of commerce and spawned innovative upstarts while ravaging one traditional industry after another. Global players from emerging economies muscled their way into business's top ranks. Wall Street was remade almost overnight by the financial crisis. And governments reversed a decades-long retreat to lay a more forceful hand on the global economy.</p>              <p>Companies found themselves in a wired, instantaneous, hypercompetitive and shrinking world, where a single misstep can be fatal and executives can plunge from heroes to outcasts in weeks.</p>              <p>""Both the exuberance and the depression -- the rise and the fall -- seem bigger and more widespread,"" says Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School.</p>              <p>Rise and Collapse</p>              <p>The decade began amid euphoria that the Internet would change the world. It did -- but not always in the ways expected.</p>              <p>On the decade's 11th day, Time Warner Inc. and America Online Inc., two icons in their industries, said they would merge, in a deal then valued at $156 billion that was seen as the herald of new era. But the marriage of old media and new media quickly foundered. The companies, each substantially shrunken, completed a divorce this year.</p>              <p>Other tech and telecom titans suffered even more. Lucent Technologies Inc., the world's ninth-most-valuable company at the decade's start, was swallowed by France's Alcatel SA in 2006. WorldCom Inc., also in the top 25, collapsed in an accounting scandal.</p>              <p>As the decade rolled on, the Internet came to be known for destroying businesses. It upended decades-old business models in fields such as media, advertising, travel and entertainment, as consumers and advertisers migrated to the digital world.</p>              <p>But that same shift created opportunity. No one epitomized that better than Google Inc. A mere 15 months old at the beginning of the decade, it morphed from a startup technology company into an advertising and media powerhouse and is now plotting a move into communications. There, it will clash with Apple Inc., which was reborn following the return of co-founder Steve Jobs in 1997. Apple's iPod and iTunes reshaped the music industry; its iPhone revolutionized communications by opening itself to independent innovators.</p>              <p>""This is what [Austrian economist Joseph] Schumpeter had in mind with his term 'creative destruction,'"" says Paul David, an economic historian at Stanford University. Industrial collapse is a ""messy, messy process,"" Mr. David says. ""It's a great drama, and watching it play out in this decade has been very interesting.""</p>              <p>The pace of business accelerated as well, with whipsaw changes in strategic fashion. Ten years ago, business stalwarts raced to develop dot-com strategies, until the dot-coms themselves went bust. From the rubble emerged a credit bubble, symbolized by the private-equity shops that took companies such as Chrysler and utility TXU Corp. private, loaded with debt. When funding evaporated during the credit crisis, cash became king and conservative stewardship was again rewarded.</p>              <p>Sharing the Spotlight</p>              <p>This was also the decade when the U.S. saw its singular pre-eminence on the world business stage substantially lessen. Ten years ago, seven of the world's 10 most valuable companies were based in the U.S. Today, only four are; three are based in China, and one each in Brazil, Australia and the U.K.</p>              <p>Both small retailers and industrial behemoths such as General Electric Co. now view their suppliers, their markets and their rivals globally. GE in 2007 for the first time recorded more revenue from outside the U.S. than inside, joining consumer brands such as Coca-Cola Co. and Procter &amp; Gamble Co.</p>              <p>Other U.S. mainstays succumbed to international rivals, most notably in the auto industry. In 2008, Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. knocked General Motors Corp. from its 77-year reign as the world's leading auto maker by units sold. This year, there will be more cars sold in China than in the U.S.</p>              <p>The financial crisis and recession forced GM into a government-supervised bankruptcy and aid package. Among the prospective buyers for its parts are several Chinese companies.</p>              <p>U.S. companies that had viewed emerging countries as markets now ""also have to look at them as competitors,"" says Ms. Kanter, the Harvard professor.</p>              <p>Surging demand from emerging economies contributed to an upward trend in commodity prices. Oil, selling for $25 a barrel 10 years ago, topped $140 in mid-2008, before retreating. That propelled seven oil companies into the ranks of the world's 25 most valuable companies, up from two a decade ago.</p>              <p>The march to an integrated global economy has not been smooth. Post-9/11 political opposition in the U.S. stymied plans by China's Cnooc Ltd. to buy Unocal Corp., and by a Dubai company to manage U.S. ports. A sweeping effort to lower global trade barriers -- known as the Doha round of talks -- has stalled.</p>              <p>Resistance grew as the economy soured. The U.S. economic-stimulus package included several ""Buy American"" provisions; numerous countries restricted immigration and sent once-welcome foreigners packing. The World Trade Organization projects global trade will fall 9% this year, the biggest drop since World War II.</p>              <p>Strengthened national boundaries mirrored the growing role of government in the economy, in the wake of the financial crisis. For three decades, government had been in retreat, disassembling regulatory structures perceived as stifling innovation and growth. But the financial crisis and recession often made the government the lender, and investor, of first and last resort. At decade's close, the U.S. government owns about 60% of GM, 38% of Citigroup Inc. and 80% of American International Group Inc.</p>              <p>In that light, Edward Whitacre Jr. may just be the executive of the decade. Ten years ago, Mr. Whitacre was smashing government barriers to reassemble much of the old AT&amp;T Corp. Today, he is effectively a government servant, as chairman and interim chief executive of GM.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Erin White contributed to this article.</p>              <p>Credit: By Scott Thurm</p>                      "

The acquisition is Apache's second in the past week. On Monday, the company said it would buy shallow-water Gulf of Mexico assets from Devon Energy Corp. for $1.05 billion.</p>              <p>Apache's buying spree highlights a sudden boom in oil-patch deals as bigger, more financially stable oil companies snap up assets from cash-strapped rivals.</p>              <p>In December, Exxon Mobil Corp. said it would buy XTO Energy Inc. for $31 billion. More recently, Chinese oil company Sinopec agreed to pay $4.65 billion for Canadian oil-sands assets owned by ConocoPhillips.</p>              <p>Most of those and other recent deals, however, involved big international companies buying into onshore oil-and-gas fields in the U.S. and Canada. Many analysts had expected a similar move from Apache. But Apache has long rejected such deals as too expensive.</p>              <p>Instead, Apache is buying Mariner, a company that gets 85% of its oil and gas from the Gulf of Mexico.</p>              <p>The deal, Apache's first corporate acquisition in 14 years, cements the company's position in the shallow waters of the Gulf and gives it a chance to break into deep-water exploration, where it has little experience.</p>              <p>""This is a very important strategic step for Apache,"" Chief Executive Steven Farris said. ""This is the right time for us to enter the deep water.""</p>              <p>Mr. Farris said the deal will make Apache the biggest U.S. independent oil producer, a category that includes Devon and Anadarko Petroleum Corp.</p>              <p>Mariner, also based in Houston, is one of a handful of smaller companies to embrace deep-water projects, which are more often the province of international giants because of their vast expense and years-long development times.</p>              <p>But while offshore projects are risky and expensive, they can be hugely profitable. Anadarko, which is similar in size to Apache, has had a string of high-profile successes in the Gulf of Mexico, Africa and Brazil. Mr. Farris said Apache will ""never be a primarily deep-water player"" but new technologies have made such fields more attractive than in the past. ""This wasn't a knee-jerk decision,"" Mr. Farris said.</p>              <p>The deal values Mariner's shares at $26.22, a 45% premium to Wednesday's closing price, on top of the near-doubling the stock has seen the past year.</p>              <p>Credit: By Ben Casselman and Angel Gonzalez</p>                      "

The deal hasn't been finalized, but MUFG will pay $8 billion to $9 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, a premium of about one-third to Morgan Stanley's closing share price Friday.</p>              <p>Also Monday, Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan's largest brokerage house by market cap, won an auction for the Asian operations of Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which is in bankruptcy-court protection. Nomura is paying $225 million for the equities, fixed- income and investment-banking operations of Lehman across the region, including in Japan and Australia, according to a person familiar with the situation, and includes $50 million in goodwill.</p>              <p>The moves show how the U.S. financial crisis has opened up opportunities for cash-rich foreign companies from Asia to the Middle East. While many had expected Chinese banks to become more prominent players, it is the Japanese financial companies, which have been relatively unscathed by the financial crisis so far, that are acting aggressively.</p>              <p>One reason is that after years of caution spent weathering the economic woes at home, Japan's banks are looking for growth. Japan remains the world's second-largest economy as measured by gross domestic output, but with its graying population, it is a growth laggard. In order to secure future prosperity, its institutions have to look abroad.</p>              <p>Nevertheless, the investments in the U.S. financial sector have come as a surprise, given Japan's reputation for risk aversion. Over the past year, sovereign wealth funds from Singapore to Abu Dhabi have taken huge hits on their investments.</p>              <p>Morgan Stanley needed the capital infusion because it and other investment banks found that they didn't have enough balance-sheet strength to support leveraged bets on markets from U.S. mortgages to international stocks. Morgan Stanley secured an investment from China Investment Corp., an investment arm of the Chinese government, late last year.</p>              <p>MUFG has been the most aggressive of the Japanese banks. Realizing there weren't adequate growth opportunities at home, MUFG officials have repeatedly said they were talking to several companies overseas to find investment opportunities that would help the bank expand its presence in strategic areas such as investment banking.</p>              <p>The first such deal was announced in August. MUFG agreed to pay a little more than $10 billion for the 35% of UnionBanCal Corp. that it hadn't already owned, making the San Francisco bank holding company a wholly owned subsidiary.</p>              <p>On Monday, an MUFG spokesman said the company wishes to partner with Morgan Stanley across a wide range of investing activities. If the deal closes, a representative of MUFG will join the Morgan Stanley board.</p>              <p>John J. Mack, Morgan Stanley's chairman and chief executive officer, said, ""This strategic alliance with Mitsubishi UFJ can put Morgan Stanley in an even stronger position as we look to realize the opportunities we see in the rapidly changing financial marketplace.""</p>              <p>Other financial companies have also invested in Western banks recently. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Japan's No. 2 bank by market cap, in June said it would inject nearly $1 billion in the U.K.'s Barclays PLC. Mizuho Financial Group in January said it would provide $1.2 billion to Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. through the purchase of preferred shares.</p>              <p>The deals illustrate the reversal of fortunes between the financial sectors in Japan and the U.S. A decade ago, Japanese banks were damaged from their own bad-loan problems, requiring the government to spend nearly $440 billion to strengthen them. Many financial companies have consolidated and restructured since then, and have regained their health recently.</p>              <p>Many have been eager to expand overseas to keep their businesses growing at a time when the domestic market is shrinking because of a declining population.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Aaron Lucchetti contributed to this article.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p>              <p>Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. agreed to pay roughly $3.5 billion for the 35% of UnionBanCal Corp. that it didn't already own.

Financing is difficult to find, and many of the sovereign-wealth funds that might have been interested have been burned by Western investments. AIG said it is determined to keep the assets together rather than sell them piecemeal, with lower prices.</p>              <p>At the same time, the outlook in export-dependent Asia is souring, reducing the flexibility of local insurers. The industry's regional growth rates are down because many Asian insurers drew their growth in past years from selling consumers investment products rather than conservative insurance products, said Sunil Garg, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.</p>              <p>Mr. Garg believes AIA's businesses in individual markets ""could be an interesting business [for local firms] to acquire if they sold country by country.""</p>              <p>AIG spokeswoman Patricia Chua declined to comment on hurdles. ""AIG remains focused on inviting strategic investor(s) to take a minority interest in AIA,"" she said in a statement. ""The divestment is being conducted in a smart, disciplined and competitive process. There is no intention to sell AIA on a piecemeal basis.""</p>              <p>AIG still could obtain a full price for the assets because of their breadth and quality. Industry executives said building an equivalent network of 200,000 agents in the 15 markets AIA serves would be a monumental task. Asia also is seen as a long-term growth market, as affluence leads to greater consumer appetite for insurance.</p>              <p>Some potential buyers argue that AIG eventually will be forced to sell a majority stake in the business because few potential buyers will be willing to spend that amount of cash without gaining control. The sale of AIA is being managed by Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</p>              <p>AIG Chief Executive Edward Liddy, who took the top job as part of a U.S. government bailout of the insurance company, faces pressure to get a high price for the assets as the government's overall aid efforts swell. He flagged plans to meet with potential buyers of the AIA unit this month in New York at a Hong Kong news conference in mid-December. At the time he said AIG would take its time weighing offers for the AIA unit in order to avoid a ""fire sale.""</p>              <p>A sale would be one of the biggest mergers-and-acquisitions deals in Asia. It has attracted strong interest from bankers at a time when the flow of capital into the region from U.S. and European companies is slowing and many large Asian investors, such as sovereign-wealth funds China Investment Corp. and Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd., have been hurt by investments overseas.</p>              <p>Interest was expected to come from such funds, as well as from Asian insurers and Western rivals. Potential buyers for AIA include Prudential PLC of the U.K., Prudential Financial Inc. of the U.S. and a number of Asian insurers. Potential bidders are attracted to the business because of its strong franchise across Asia. ""We continue to monitor AIG's disposal program,"" said Chad Tendler, a spokesman for Prudential of the U.K.</p>              <p>The ranks of potential local buyers have thinned. Last October, Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. of China Ltd., reported a third-quarter net loss of 7.81 billion yuan ($1.14 billion) on a 15.7 billion yuan mark-to-market loss on its 5% holding in Fortis NV.

It posted an 11% jump in operating earnings and an 8% decline in revenue from a year ago. In a sign the tech industry is leaving the recession behind, it also raised its revenue forecast for the fiscal year.</p>              <p>By buying 3Com, a onetime leading tech company that has fallen on tougher times this decade, H-P is aiming to goose its growth. The move also puts H-P more squarely on the turf of Cisco Systems Inc.</p>              <p>David Donatelli, H-P's vice president in charge of the corporate-computer division, said 3Com has a better set of networking products for large corporate clients than H-P currently sells and a market share of more than 30% in the China networking market. With the deal, Mr. Donatelli said, ""we get industry-leading products.""</p>              <p>The 3Com deal is the latest step in a march toward tech-industry consolidation by behemoths like H-P, Cisco, Dell Inc. and Oracle Corp. In the past, these companies largely stuck to their own niches, with Cisco specializing in networking gear, Dell in personal computers, Oracle in enterprise software, and H-P in PCs and printers.</p>              <p>But amid shrinking tech spending over the past year, these giants have pursued new growth by spilling into each other's turf, sparking new competition and undoing what had been friendly relationships.</p>              <p>Since last year, Cisco has moved into servers, previously the province of H-P and Dell. Meanwhile, H-P took aim at Cisco with investments in networking. Earlier this year, Oracle snapped up server maker Sun Microsystems Inc., throwing it into the computer business.</p>              <p>The goal now is to sell ""complete systems"" made of chips, computers, storage devices and software, said Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison earlier this year. He is betting that approach will appeal to corporate customers tired of assembling technology from multiple vendors.</p>              <p>A recent spate of deal making in the tech sector has bolstered the move of large tech companies toward becoming one-stop shops. Dell recently purchased services company Perot Systems, for instance, moving it squarely into the tech-consulting turf dominated by International Business Machines Corp. and H-P. And Cisco paid $3 billion for video-conferencing maker Tandberg SA in a move aimed against H-P's videoconferencing systems.</p>              <p>Not all tech giants are moving toward the one-stop shop, however. Motorola Inc., which is grappling with how to position itself amid tough competition, is trying to get out of the networking-gear market by attempting to sell off that division of its business, for instance. And several years ago, IBM sold its PC unit to Lenovo Group Ltd.</p>              <p>An H-P acquisition of 3Com is also the latest move by H-P CEO Mark Hurd to remake the company. Since he joined in 2005, he has cut costs and beefed up the company in such areas as tech consulting. Last year, H-P purchased Electronic Data Systems Inc. for $13 billion, putting it in stronger competition with IBM.</p>              <p>H-P, which was heavily reliant on printer-ink sales for profits when Mr. Hurd joined, now gets a more diversified profit stream.</p>              <p>At H-P, a networking acquisition had been considered for months, say people familiar with the matter. While H-P has for years had a networking division, called ProCurve, it didn't step up its investment in the business until last year. That was when it shifted Marius Haas, H-P's former mergers-and-acquisitions chief, to oversee ProCurve. H-P has since expanded ProCurve offerings and tried to combine them with server computers.</p>              <p>More recently, H-P began looking to bulk up the business with an acquisition, say the people familiar with the matter. In recent months, H-P had discussions about buying Brocade Communications Systems Inc., which makes high-end networking equipment, these people say.</p>              <p>Buying 3Com was a surprise because 3Com's business is largely focused on China and it's best known for being ""a low-end provider of networking,"" like H-P, said Ashok Kumar, an analyst with Collins Stewart. But Mr. Donatelli, the H-P executive, said that perception comes largely from the fact that much of 3Com's high-end business is in China. After testing 3Com's high-end equipment, he said, H-P decided to replace much of its current internal networking gear with 3Com appliances.</p>              <p>3Com, founded in 1979, was a pioneer in a networking technology dubbed Ethernet that became a mainstay as PCs were connected together and later to the Internet. Over the years, it became a broader player in networking and other businesses, partly through acquisitions.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Don Clark contributed to this article</p>              <p>Credit: By Justin Scheck</p>                      "
"261","2009-11-04","Morgan Stanley Will Sell Its CICC Stake","399138881","Wall Street Journal","C.3","            >                                        >                          <p>HONG KONG -- Morgan Stanley has restarted the sale of its stake in China's first joint-venture investment bank, China International Capital Corp., a deal that could fetch more than $1 billion and would remove a major roadblock in the Wall Street firm's effort to build a bigger presence in China.</p>              <p>Morgan Stanley asked potential buyers to submit indicative first-round bids Tuesday for its 34.3% stake in CICC, according to people familiar with the situation. Expected bidders for the stake include several international private-equity firms, according to the people.</p>              <p>If consummated, the deal would be a breakthrough for Morgan Stanley. The Wall Street bank helped found CICC together with China Construction Bank Corp. in 1995, a pioneering move at the time. But after disputes emerged with the venture's management over personnel, the firm's culture and its dealings with other foreign banks, Morgan Stanley became a passive investor.</p>              <p>Morgan Stanley hopes to form a joint-venture securities firm with Shanghai-based China Fortune Securities Co., in which it can have more influence over management.</p>              <p>Competitors, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG, already operate their own securities joint ventures on the mainland, giving them greater access to China's domestic market.</p>              <p>Chinese regulators won't approve a new securities joint venture for Morgan Stanley unless it sells the CICC stake.</p>              <p>In late 2007, Morgan Stanley started a process to sell the stake, ultimately ending the bidding in early 2008 after offers came in below its expectations amid the onset of the global credit crisis.</p>              <p>A piece of an investment bank positioned to profit from the growth of China's capital markets could prove attractive for private-equity firms that have raised billions of dollars for Asia-focused funds. As one of China's top investment banks, CICC has specialized in sprucing up state-owned firms ahead of initial public offerings.</p>              <p>China's sovereign-wealth fund, China Investment Corp., is its largest shareholder, with 43.35%, after inheriting the stake originally held by China Construction Bank. Another sovereign-wealth fund, Government of Singapore Investment Corp., holds a 7.35% stake.</p>              <p>CICC's net profit dropped 49% to 627.4 million yuan ($91.9 million) last year from 1.24 billion yuan in 2007. Profit is expected to rise this year amid a rebound in China's capital markets, one of the few bright spots in global finance. CICC has taken on little debt and has focused on fee income, leaving it with a strong balance sheet.</p>              <p>A sticking point in the negotiations between the potential buyers in the last sale process was a share program created to compensate CICC's employees with equity in the firm. CICC's management, led by chief executive Levin Zhu, had asked potential buyers of Morgan Stanley's stake to support an extension of the program. Mr. Zhu is the son of former Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji.</p>              <p>The program granted employees ""phantom shares"" that don't have voting power but give holders dividends similar to those given ordinary shareholders. If converted to ordinary shares, the phantom shares issued would dilute Morgan Stanley's stake to about 27% from 34.3%, according to people familiar with the situation.</p>              <p>Since taking over last year, CICC Chairman Li Jiange has worked to resolve the dispute between shareholders and CICC's management over the share program, according to people familiar with the situation. They have made progress on the issue, making it easier for Morgan Stanley to sell the stake and giving more certainty to potential buyers.</p>              <p>Morgan Stanley would turn a profit on its investment. It paid $35 million for its stake in the venture in 1995, though it also contributed the time of bankers who worked with CICC in its start-up years.</p>              <p>Credit: By Rick Carew</p>                      "

Both parties have something to offer.</p>              <p>Some factions in Accra favor a deal with the Chinese, because that is expected to open the door to additional infrastructure loans from Beijing, said Sebastian Spio-Garbrah, an Africa analyst with the Eurasia Group, which advises corporations on overseas risk.</p>              <p>Others worry that a Chinese deal would delay the start of oil production at Jubilee, postponing the flow of much-needed revenue.</p>              <p>The government will likely favor Exxon's bid after receiving assurances ""that it will quickly commence development and production . . . and generate much needed foreign-exchange revenues,"" Mr. Spio-Garbrah wrote in a note to clients.</p>              <p>Jennifer Cooke, head of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the government ""is under a fair amount of budget pressure,"" and slashed domestic spending by 15% earlier this year to cope with declining revenue.</p>              <p>The Jubilee field is expected to come online in the third quarter of 2010 and eventually produce 120,000 barrels a day.

Companies such as Cnooc are backed by a government flush with foreign currency and with a growing desire to secure long-term access to commodities. Their global ambitions are strengthening the hand of oil-rich nations in their negotiations with foreign oil companies.</p>              <p>Exxon and Cnooc would both be vying for Kosmos Energy's stake in Jubilee, a discovery that is estimated to hold 1.8 billion barrels of oil. With nearby discoveries in Sierra Leone, the region is emerging as a major new oil region and Ghana is expected to be an oil exporter by the end of next year. Jubilee is one of the largest oil discoveries in recent years and holds the type of light, sweet crude oil that is most sought after by global markets.</p>              <p>Last week, Dallas-based Kosmos told bidders by letter it had ""entered into an exclusive binding agreement"" with Exxon to sell its 23.5% stake in Jubilee. Kosmos is partly owned by private-equity firms Blackstone Group LP and Warburg Pincus.</p>              <p>A rival bid could set up months of legal and political wrangling, said one person familiar with the matter, because Kosmos feels it can sell the stake to whomever it wants, so long as the Ghanaian government gives its consent. The Ghanaian government ""can't be unreasonable in their refusal,"" this person added.</p>              <p>News of the Exxon agreement infuriated the Ghanaian government and GNPC, which had been trying to negotiate to increase its 13.8% stake in the field. ""I don't see the Exxon-Kosmos deal as done,"" said GNPC chief executive Thomas Manu said in an interview this weekend. The Ghanaian oil minister also expressed his unhappiness with not being notified that Kosmos had made a deal with Exxon and said he believed the country had the right to block the offer.</p>              <p>Last week, people close to the deal said they were confident the Ghanaians would approve the sale of the Kosmos stake to Exxon because bringing in the global oil giant would help ensure the discovery is developed quickly and on budget. For a nation such as Ghana, Jubilee could be a once-in-a-lifetime infusion of foreign currency and handing the field over to the untested Chinese, with less experience in developing offshore oilfields, could be a gamble.</p>              <p>Ghana hired Morgan Stanley as its investment banker to advise it on the process.</p>              <p>Cnooc and GNPC ""plan to make a strong counter bid in the next few days,"" said one person familiar with the matter. Cnooc sent a senior delegation of officials to the Ghana capital of Accra a couple weeks back, including Cnooc Chairman Fu Chengyu. They committed to an equity stake for GNPC in this deal and talked about wanting to help the Ghanaians develop their national oil company.</p>              <p>Cnooc told Ghana ""it could help them develop their national oil company and that they are kindred spirits"" in that process, said one of these people.</p>              <p>Cnooc board secretary Xiao Zongwei declined to comment. ""We don't comment on market rumors,"" he said.</p>              <p>Mr. Fu has said he is more interested in buying specific assets such as oil or gas fields instead of buying companies.</p>              <p>While Cnooc would provide the bulk of the equity in the deal, the size and structure of the bid is still being worked out, according to people familiar with the talks.</p>              <p>In addition to Kosmos and GNPC, Tullow Oil PLC and Anadarko Petroleum Corp. own sizable stakes in the field, making it unclear what company would become operator of the field. Exxon spokesman Patrick McGinn declined to comment on the matter. Last week, he said that Exxon ""routinely evaluates potential development opportunities around the world.""</p>              <p>If the Chinese manage to dislodge the deal, it would be a setback for Exxon's efforts to find new regions to use their oil-development expertise.</p>              <p>Chinese oil companies have had a mixed record in Africa recently. Libya vetoed a $462 million bid by China National Petroleum Corp. for Verenex Energy Inc., an independent company focused on exploration in the north African nation.

"267","2005-07-01","Many Oil Experts Unconcerned Over China Unocal Bid","409828841","The Washington Post","D.01","            >                                        >                          <p>   The Chinese are coming  --  for a U.S. oil company. So should Americans worry, or shrug?</p>              <p>   Alarms are ringing on Capitol Hill over last week's takeover bid by CNOOC Ltd. for Unocal Corp. The proposed $18.5 billion deal, lawmakers warn, has ominous implications for national security  --  in particular, the security of U.S. oil lifelines.</p>              <p>   Congressional heavyweights voicing opposition include Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Rep. Ralph M. Hall (D-Tex.), chairman of the subcommittee on energy and air quality. The ability of the United States to obtain the oil and gas needed to fuel its economy, they wrote in a June 27 letter to President Bush, is ""threatened by China's aggressive tactics to lock up energy supplies around the world that are largely dedicated for their own use.""</p>              <p>   But it is hard to see how the Chinese purchase of Unocal could affect petroleum availability or otherwise endanger U.S. security, many global energy experts say. China may be a potential military adversary, and congressional frustration over Chinese trade policy drives much of the animus toward the deal. Still, some fears about China's grab for oil reserves are at odds with experts' view of how global oil markets work.</p>              <p>   Those markets are vast and fluid. Known oil reserves exceed 1 trillion barrels, daily production averages more than 80 million barrels, and traders readily swap tankers full of crude to balance excess demand in some parts of the globe with excess supply elsewhere. Accordingly, said Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy specialist at the Institute for International Economics, ""there is absolutely no reason why we should care"" who owns Unocal's oil and gas reserves, which total about 1.75 billion barrels.</p>              <p>   Even though Chinese control over Unocal's reserves, which are mostly in Asia, might ensure that the company's petroleum was shipped to China during an energy shortage, ""the cost of oil will be set between world supply and demand, and not by arrangements like this,"" agreed Robert J. Priddle, the former executive director of the Paris-based International Energy Agency. ""This won't change the price of oil, or the availability of oil.""</p>              <p>   Priddle said that critics of the CNOOC bid are correct in noting that China behaves unlike most oil-market players. China depends on imports for about one-third of its oil needs, so Chinese leaders have struck deals in Latin America, Canada, and also in countries unfriendly to the United States, notably Iran and Sudan. CNOOC, which is 70 percent owned by the Chinese government, may be seeking to buy Unocal at the behest of top officials in Beijing, Priddle said.</p>              <p>   ""They're in a panic; they're relatively newly dependent on oil imports, and think they must do something to secure their own supply,"" he said.</p>              <p>   During the oil crises of the 1970s and 1980s, Priddle and other experts recalled, several European countries established national oil companies with the aim of assuring supplies, and nations such as France cozied up to Iran, Iraq and other oil suppliers. But when oil shipments were cut off, ""they had the same problems we did"" with higher energy prices, said Amy Myers Jaffe, associate director of the energy program at Rice University's James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy.</p>              <p>   ""Owning reserves doesn't change the price,"" Jaffe said. ""If the price of oil goes to $125 a barrel, and China owns a field in Sudan, the price for them is still $125."" By hoarding oil for their own use, the Chinese would miss the chance to sell at the higher price, which would effectively cost them the same as if they bought oil on the open market, she said.</p>              <p>   Under such a scenario, the United States would be able to obtain the oil it needed regardless of who owns the reserves being pumped. ""The U.S. economy is a very strong economy; if there is a sudden cutoff of Saudi oil, and Americans suddenly have to pay a lot more to get gasoline, we'll do it,"" Jaffe said.</p>              <p>   Some critics of China dispute these arguments, and contend that the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment  in the United States should scrutinize the deal. This body can block the foreign purchase of a U.S. firm or insist on new terms, though it has rarely found grounds for such actions.</p>              <p>   China is ""not a market economy  --  that's the real challenge we have here,"" said Michael R. Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a group established by Congress. ""They see resource acquisition as an integral part of their military plans. We need to look at it on the same basis.""</p>              <p>   Gal Luft, executive director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, said that to the extent China acquires reserves from countries such as Canada, ""It means we will be more dependent on the Middle East and other more unstable areas."" As a result, ""this deal should be viewed as a red flag.""</p>              <p>   Some of the ammunition for the opponents has come from an interested party  --  in this case, Chevron Corp., which has made a rival $16.5 billion bid for Unocal. In an interview, Peter J. Robertson, Chevron's vice chairman, maintained that U.S. economic interests are at stake mainly because a combined CNOOC-Unocal company would be less able to exploit Unocal's deepwater petroleum reserves than Chevron would, given Chevron's expertise.</p>              <p>   In such an enormous world energy market, ""a few percentage points [of global production] can really make a difference"" to prices, Robertson said. But asked if he thought a Chevron victory over CNOOC would affect production that much, Robertson said no.</p>              <p>   The issue may be academic, because the furor over CNOOC's bid could prompt Unocal shareholders to approve the Chevron bid at a meeting scheduled for Aug. 10, well before CNOOC could clear its own bid. Even though Chevron's offer is lower than that of CNOOC, the certainty that Chevron would pass muster in Washington gives the U.S. oil giant an edge.</p>              <p>   ""In the environment we're in,"" Robertson noted, ""I think Unocal shareholders will say, 'The Chevron deal looks pretty good.' ""</p>              <p>   But there are dangers in stiff-arming Beijing, especially given China's clout as a purchaser of things such as Boeing airplanes and U.S. Treasury bonds.</p>              <p>   ""If we were to say no to [CNOOC's bid], it would likely stimulate just the sort of nationalist reaction in China that we should want to discourage,"" said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. ""We have a national security interest in integrating China into the global economy, and this [permitting the Chinese takeover of Unocal] seems to me one way to do it.""</p>                      "

But most of China's overseas investments have focused on establishing new channels to sell its manufactured goods.</p>              <p>   Last year, Lenovo Group Ltd., China's largest computer maker, struck a $1.75 billion deal to take over International Business Machines Corp.'s personal computer business, twinning its ability to make low-cost machines with one of the signature brands in technology. The Chinese consumer electronics firm TCL Corp. purchased the television business of French manufacturer Thomson SA, and with it the rights to the RCA logo.</p>              <p>   Analysts saw Haier's interests in Maytag as a continuation of that trend, a deal that would have used the venerable U.S. brand name to sell machines that could be made in the Chinese company's existing factories.</p>              <p>   Haier's decision reduces the fight for Maytag to two players: Whirlpool Corp., which Sunday offered to buy the company for about $1.4 billion in cash and stock, and a group of U.S. private equity investment firms led by Ripplewood Holdings LLC. Ripplewood has offered to buy Maytag for about $1.1 billion. Maytag directors have approved Ripplewood's offer and a shareholder vote on that deal is scheduled for Aug. 19.

Consider, for instance, the very self-interested testimony of Fu Chengyu, the chief executive of CNOOC Ltd., the oil company owned by the Chinese government, which is currently endeavoring to buy Unocal Corp.</p>              <p>   ""The Chinese people and government are learning from the U.S.,"" Fu told the Los Angeles Times last Friday. ""We are adopting the free- trade system very quickly. . . . We are using U.S. bankers, advisors, exactly meeting the processes of U.S. market requirements"" for mergers and acquisitions. On Monday China's foreign ministry warned U.S. politicians to ""stop interfering in the normal commercial exchanges between enterprises of the two countries.""</p>              <p>   Now, there's a statement of American values for our time. And we may even forgive the Chinese just a bit if they are confused over which values we Americans take seriously. Freedom of religion? Speech? Assembly? If those really matter to Americans, why are all these American companies building factories in China to take advantage of workers whose labor comes cheap partly because they lack the freedom to better their lot?</p>              <p>   If nothing else, CNOOC's bid for Unocal is forcing us to prioritize our conflicting ideals. The offer pits traditional nationalism against the conservative belief in free trade and laissez-faire capitalism. It comes as a fire bell in the night for the pure free-traders, what with communist China en route to becoming our chief capitalist rival. Surely there must be some companies  --  Boeing Co., say, or Intel Corp.  --  whose sale to the Chinese government even the Wall Street Journal editorial board would oppose.</p>              <p>   However extensive China's involvement in our economy, our involvement in China's will surely pose further challenges to our values. Already a number of American businesses there, Wal-Mart first and foremost, are moving their contractors' factories from China's more developed southern coast to even lower-wage and less- regulated inland regions. (It may help to think of these corporations as new-age versions of the legendary hooligans of the Old West: When the law comes to Dodge, they strike out for the next boomtown where there's still no sheriff.)</p>              <p>   But China is home to more labor strife than any country in the world. What will happen when these illegal strikes grow even more widespread, when workers demand democracy and the right to form unions? In the next iteration of Tiananmen  Square, will American business and its apologists side with the tanks or the man standing in the street to block them?</p>              <p>   This August still another conundrum for the champions of globalized capitalism will emerge. The Service Employees International Union (SEIU), which represents the janitors and is endeavoring to represent the security guards in the high-rises of major cities, will convene in Chicago a gathering of similar unions from around the world. In many nations the janitors and guards are now employed by the same global building maintenance and security companies. (Even so profoundly American a company as the once- goonish Pinkertons is now owned by a Scandinavian multinational.)</p>              <p>   The SEIU and its allies want to build a global union in a global industry with global employers, enabling security guards in nations with strong worker rights and contracts to pressure employers who are exploiting security guards in nations with no such rights or contracts. Janitors and security guards don't run the risk of their jobs being shipped abroad, but the security guards of Los Angeles or Pretoria may well need the assistance of the security guards of Copenhagen to win a living wage.</p>              <p>   Whether a global union, or just an alliance of national unions, will emerge from the Chicago meeting is impossible to predict. But global unions are surely coming, and when they do, they'll pose a challenge for polemicists for the new global order. For if the goal of globalization is simply to maximize shareholder value, then the rise of global labor will be viewed as some new pandemic, threatening profit margins with  --  oh, the horror  --  a fairer distribution of income. But for commentators who insist that globalization is today's way to realize the greatest good for the greatest number, the advent of global unions could force them to stop their ad hominem attacks on their critics as protectionists and compel them to explain what model of globalization they have in mind. Do we stand, with the Chinese communists at Unocal, for the interests of shareholders? Or is America about something more than that?</p>              <p>   Last week, I wrote about the efforts of 19-year-old Marie Gonzalez, a star high school student whose undocumented parents brought her to Missouri from Costa Rica when she was 5, to avoid deportation, set for yesterday, back to Costa Rica. Missouri's two senators declined to intervene on her behalf.

Williamson had informed his counterpart at Cnooc, Fu Chengyu, that if Cnooc bumped its bid up from $67 per share it could probably knock out rival bidder Chevron Corp. and seal a deal.</p>              <p>   But in a phone conversation the next day, Fu balked.</p>              <p>   He told Williamson that Cnooc would consider raising its bid only if Unocal dropped a demand that Cnooc pay a $500 million breakup fee to Chevron, which already had a signed merger agreement with Unocal. Fu also demanded that in return for a larger offer, Unocal start trying to convince members of Congress that a Cnooc deal would not threaten U.S. national security.</p>              <p>   These vivid details come from an updated proxy statement Unocal sent to shareholders and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. Unocal filed the proxy to update shareholders on the terms of Chevron's latest offer. But the filing also provides a rare behind-the-scenes look into a high-profile takeover fight that has captivated Wall Street and stoked political fears in Washington about the ambitions of a rising China.</p>              <p>   According to the proxy statement, Williamson ""expressed dissatisfaction"" to Fu that the Chinese executive would seek to negotiate the breakup fee, which Williamson considered a settled issue.  And he told Fu that Unocal could not start lobbying right away because to do so would violate the company's agreement with Chevron.</p>              <p>   Williamson held a conference call with Unocal directors on July 17 and told them about his conversation with Fu, the filing stated. Despite the Cnooc chief executive's refusal to raise his bid, the board told Williamson it was still leaning toward Cnooc. The directors instructed Williamson to tell Chevron chief executive David J. O'Reilly that if Chevron wanted to keep the support of Unocal's board, the company would have to increase its offer by July 19, the day of the next scheduled Unocal board meeting.</p>              <p>   Williamson made the call and gave O'Reilly the deadline. On July 19, O'Reilly called Williamson and raised Chevron's bid from about $60.50 per share to $63.01, including a larger cash portion. That night, Unocal's board approved the revised offer, and it issued a news release the next morning urging shareholders to approve it in an Aug. 10 vote.</p>              <p>   That is where the fight for Unocal stands  --  but it is by no means over.</p>              <p>   Cnooc has not dropped out and may yet raise its bid. The company refused to comment on its plans or on Unocal's new proxy statement on Monday. Several Unocal shareholders said they viewed the proxy as evidence that Unocal's board is open to Cnooc and would be responsive to a higher offer.</p>              <p>   Several shareholders said they believed Cnooc would wait to raise its offer until it learns the fate of legislative attempts to slow down or derail its bid. ""We can only hope that Cnooc is not suffering from Washington fatigue,"" said Peter Schoenfeld, who has been supportive of Cnooc's bid and whose hedge fund firm controls about 650,000 Unocal shares.</p>              <p>   The Unocal filing also details previously undisclosed provisions of Cnooc's proposed financing. In addition to questions about energy security, some members of Congress have said Cnooc benefits from below-market financing courtesy of Beijing. Cnooc has said its government-controlled parent company will provide $7 billion in financing, including a $2.5 billion, 30-year, interest-free loan and a $4.5 billion, 30-year loan at 3.5 percent interest. The Unocal filing on Monday said the interest on the $4.5 billion loan could be waived if Cnooc's credit rating falls below a certain level.</p>              <p>   The filing also describes why Unocal directors believe Chevron's latest bid  --  valued at about $17.3 billion  --  is superior to Cnooc's $18.5 billion offer. It says Unocal's board would be willing to accept the higher risk associated with Cnooc's bid if the Chinese company offered a ""sufficient"" price. But it says Cnooc has so far failed to offer that price. Based on Unocal's apparent willingness to accept Cnooc's $67-per-share offer even before Chevron raised its bid, shareholders say they believe Unocal is demanding that Cnooc pay a 10 percent premium over whatever Chevron offers. That would mean Cnooc would need to bid slightly over $70 per share to secure Unocal's support.</p>              <p>   Among other risks to a Cnooc deal, the filing cites proposed congressional legislation to block the deal or to create delays that could add ""six to nine months"" to the approval process. Barring any legislation, final authority to approve or block a Cnooc bid would rest with the Bush administration.</p>              <p>   The proxy also includes a draft copy of a tentative agreement between Unocal and Cnooc. The agreement includes the creation by Cnooc of a $2.5 billion U.S. escrow account. According to the agreement, Unocal could try to claim the funds if Cnooc violated a merger agreement. But the proxy describes the escrow provisions as ""complex and untested."" It also notes that rejection of a Cnooc deal in Washington would not amount to a breach of contract and would not entitle Unocal to recover the $2.5 billion.</p>              <p>   The proxy statement says Chevron's proposal includes 60 percent Chevron stock, offering Unocal shareholders the opportunity to continue to invest in the combined entity. Cnooc's offer is all cash. The statement suggests that Chevron's stock has probably been held down by the prospect of a bidding war for Unocal and could rise significantly once a deal is completed. Chevron stock rose 58 cents, or 1 percent, on Monday to close at $58.37. That makes Chevron's offer worth  $63.67 per Unocal share.</p>                      "

The development of economic and trade cooperation between China and the United States conforms to the interests of both sides.""</p>              <p>   Those words, the latest rhetorical volley in an escalating trade battle, officially elevated the takeover battle for Unocal into a bilateral issue involving Washington and Beijing, raising the stakes of  the outcome.</p>              <p>   CNOOC's bid comes as China's emerging force in the global economy continues to sow international tensions over competition for natural resources, impacts on the environment, trade balances and security relationships. The deal would be the latest in a string of Chinese purchases of foreign companies as Beijing encourages domestic firms to seek new markets abroad and secure raw materials for China's aggressive industrialization. The Chinese government has urged energy companies in particular to buy foreign oil fields as China's consumption soars, deepening worries about the country's access to supplies.</p>              <p>   Already, CNOOC's bid has taken China across a new threshold: It has unleashed the first takeover battle between a Chinese company and a U.S. firm, the oil giant Chevron Corp., which has its own deal to buy Unocal, for $16.5 billion. If completed, CNOOC's purchase  -- its bid is for $18.5 billion  --  would be the largest foreign takeover ever made by a Chinese firm.</p>              <p>   But as the price of oil continues to soar, underscoring the finite supply of global stocks, some members of Congress portray China's appetite for energy as a threat to U.S. interests. They are painting CNOOC's effort to buy Unocal as an attempt to siphon off oil that would otherwise land in the United States, a proposition that analysts call dubious because most of Unocal's outstanding contracts supply customers in Asia.</p>              <p>   As the House adopted its resolution Thursday by a 398 to 15 vote, some noted that CNOOC remains under the majority control of the Communist Party-led state, suggesting that this alone made the deal a threat.</p>              <p>   ""We cannot, in my opinion, afford to have a major U.S. energy supplier controlled by the Communist Chinese,"" said Rep. William J. Jefferson, a Louisiana Democrat. Monday's reply from Beijing reinforced  what CNOOC has said from the beginning  --  that the deal is nothing more than an attempt to expand its business opportunities and invest capital sensibly.</p>              <p>   Long before CNOOC emerged with its unsolicited offer for Unocal, the United States-China relationship was already highly complex. There has been friction in recent months over China's roughly $160 billion trade surplus with the United States and surges this year in Chinese-made textiles reaching U.S. shores. Some U.S. trade groups accuse China of manipulating its currency, the yuan, to keep it artificially low, making Chinese goods unfairly cheap on world markets. The Bush administration has pressured China to allow its currency to float freely. China argues that it is being made a scapegoat for the decline of U.S. manufacturing.</p>              <p>   Tensions also have grown over North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons. In Washington, some suggest that China is not doing enough to pressure North Korea, its longtime ally, to return to stalled talks, while propping up the regime in Pyongyang with food and fuel. Chinese officials have criticized the United States for demonizing North Korea and undermining the possibility of progress.</p>              <p>   Taiwan is always a hot button. China claims the self-governing island as part of its territory and threatens to reclaim it by force if Taiwan's government moves toward declaring its independence. The United States is nominally pledged to come to Taiwan's aid in event of war.</p>              <p>   The battle over Unocal has injected yet another factor into this already volatile relationship ahead of a planned visit to Washington by Chinese President Hu Jintao this fall.</p>              <p>   But analysts say the issue has thus far produced little that could alter the relationship between the two governments, because Beijing has grown sophisticated at distinguishing between rhetoric from Capitol Hill  --  where Thursday's resolution was nonbinding  - -  and policy from the White House, which has said little on the subject.</p>              <p>   But whatever comes of the Unocal battle, tensions over Chinese investment are probably only beginning. Just as a rising Japan in the 1980s snapped up high-profile assets in the United States and provoked widespread American unease, China's expanding horizons are having a similar effect.</p>              <p>   Moreover, key differences between Japan of that era and current- day China could make this go-round more combustible: Japan was a U.S. military ally and part of the same ideological bloc, whereas China is viewed by many in Washington as an adversary.</p>              <p>   But the simplest reason for tension may be the amount of cash at China's disposal: As investment pours in and China's central bank buys dollars to maintain the value of its currency, the country has amassed $650 billion in foreign exchange reserves. China has plowed much of that money into U.S. Treasury bonds.</p>              <p>   But the quest for Unocal and other foreign companies is being construed by some as a sign of diversification.</p>              <p>   ""We invest too much in U.S. federal bonds, and they don't make us much money,"" said Pan Rui, a professor at the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. ""Now we're learning to invest more wisely, to try to invest in American companies and industries.""</p>                      "
"273","2005-07-06","China's Oil Bid: A Battle to Avoid . . .","409944560","The Washington Post","A.17","            >                                        >                          <p>   We cannot decide whether China is a threat or an opportunity, and until we do every discussion of our relations seems to slide into confusion and acrimony. The latest example is the noisy controversy over the bid by CNOOC Ltd. to buy the American oil company Unocal Corp. There are some real issues here, but they're lost amid all the political clamor. We're being told (to cite one congressional resolution) that a CNOOC victory might ""impair the national security"" by jeopardizing ""critical . . . energy production capacity."" The alarms sound plausible but are actually over the top.</p>              <p>   Start with the basics. On April 4 directors of Unocal (2004 revenue: $8.2 billion) accepted an offer to be bought by Chevron Corp. (revenue: $151 billion). On June 22, CNOOC (revenue: $6.7 billion) made a counteroffer. Chevron's bid, consisting of 25 percent cash and 75 percent Chevron stock, is valued at roughly $16.5 billion; CNOOC's offer is $18.5 billion, all cash, financed partly by low-interest loans from its state-owned parent company. Unocal shareholders are scheduled to vote on the Chevron proposal Aug. 10.</p>              <p>   Even if CNOOC wins, there's no danger that much U.S. oil production will be siphoned off to China. Unocal's U.S. production is tiny (57,000 barrels a day out of the total U.S. output of about 7.3 million barrels), and CNOOC pledges to keep it here. Nor is the United States being overwhelmed by Chinese investment. True, there have recently been some big transactions: the Chinese computer maker Lenovo's purchase of IBM's personal computer business, and a proposal to buy Maytag by a consortium of the Haier Group, China's largest appliance maker, and several U.S. buyout firms. But China's overall presence is modest. In 2004 Chinese firms accounted for only $490 million of U.S. direct investment out of the total foreign direct investment of $1.5 trillion (that's foreign ownership of U.S. firms, factories and real estate). Meanwhile, U.S. multinationals have $2.1 trillion of foreign investment, including $15 billion in China.</p>              <p>   Although President Bush could reject CNOOC's acquisition of Unocal on national security grounds, it's hard to see a strong justification. ""There's no national security issue here  --  zero,"" says energy economist Philip Verleger. ""Unocal doesn't have technology that needs to be kept secret.""</p>              <p>   Of course, oil could divide China and America. We may someday be competing for scarce supplies. After the United States and Japan, China is the world's third-largest oil importer. Its demand could grow 60 percent by 2020, says the International Energy Agency. All that extra demand would probably have to be satisfied by imports. China's oil policy differs from America's, says Richard D'Amato, chairman of the congressionally created U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. China wants to guarantee its future crude supplies through long-term contracts. American policy is for oil to go to the world market and be available to everyone. ""If they continue demanding control of oil at the wellhead, it's a train wreck [for everyone] in the next 10 to 15 years,"" D'Amato says.</p>              <p>   Maybe. But China faces huge obstacles, the largest being the opposition of oil-producing countries. ""They want to be able to sell to all customers,"" Verleger says. China has secured some exclusive agreements, reports energy analyst Greg Priddy. In Sudan, a Chinese oil company is producing about 150,000 barrels a day. In Iran, China signed a contract to develop a field that might yield 300,000 barrels a day. Still, these amounts are small against the world's demand of 85 million barrels a day or China's demand of 7 million barrels a day.</p>              <p>   Interestingly, however, CNOOC's bid for Unocal wouldn't much advance China's quest for secure energy supplies. CNOOC says it simply wants to expand its business. So it seems. Unocal's attraction is that it has large reserves of natural gas and oil  in Asia, but most of the resulting energy production wouldn't go to China. Unocal's natural gas in Thailand and Bangladesh is already contractually committed to local markets. Oil produced in the Caspian Sea by a consortium of 10 companies flows toward Europe by pipeline. Natural gas reserves off Indonesia, after being converted into liquefied natural gas, might be sold to China. But regardless of whether CNOOC or Chevron wins, the gas might end up in the same place. Geography matters.</p>              <p>   We shouldn't see demons where they aren't. This is mostly standard corporate combat: Two suitors want the same trophy. Chevron is probably the favorite. CNOOC's advantage lies in its subsidized loans. But Chevron is bigger and can stir anti-Chinese political fervor. Let them fight it out  --  without Washington's interference.</p>              <p>   How the United States and China construct their relations is one of today's great projects. We have many real issues with China: the undervalued yuan; possible military conflicts, notably over Taiwan; the nuclear status of North Korea; the potential economically destabilizing effects of huge trade imbalances (China's surpluses and America's deficits); China's compliance with global trade rules. We must defend our interests, but if we reflexively treat the Chinese as a threat, we will answer our own question: They will become a threat.</p>                      "

(Published 07/06/05)</p>              <p>   China's CNOOC Ltd. energy company submitted its $18.5 billion bid for Unocal Corp. to the federal government for a national security review yesterday, hoping to jump-start the regulatory process while it allays political concerns in Washington.</p>              <p>   Typically, such reviews  --  carried out by the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS  --  do not begin until a takeover bid is accepted. But by making its request quickly, CNOOC, which is 70 percent owned by the Chinese government, hoped to signal wary U.S. lawmakers that the company recognizes their concerns and is ready to cooperate. Company officials also hope to convince Unocal shareholders that U.S. regulatory requirements would not unduly delay a deal's completion.</p>              <p>   CNOOC's unsolicited bid last week to wrest Unocal from it U.S. suitor, Chevron Corp., has deepened anti-Chinese animosity in Washington. By a vote of 333 to 92, the House on Thursday passed an amendment to an appropriations bill that would bar the Treasury Department  --  which leads CFIUS  --  from spending any money to approve the CNOOC takeover.</p>              <p>   CNOOC has shored up its political position, retaining the law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld LLP to handle its lobbying, and Public Opinion Strategies, a firm with ties to the Bush White House, to lead its public relations. Chevron has been at least as active, mobilizing its Washington office and its large number of contract lobbyists, according to corporate lobbyists familiar with the oil giant's effort.</p>              <p>   Chevron, which has offered Unocal shareholders $16.5 billion in cash and stock, yesterday revealed it had already offered promotions to 25 top Unocal executives, available if shareholders accept Chevron's offer. Of those, 20 have already accepted, said Chevron spokesman Charles R. Stewart.</p>              <p>   In an interview this week, Chevron Vice Chairman Peter J. Robertson said few Unocal workers outside the company's Southern California headquarters would lose their jobs in an acquisition, implying that CNOOC could make no such promise. The promotions could entice senior Unocal executives to pressure shareholders, while signaling again that a Chevron takeover would be quick and seamless.</p>              <p>   Unocal shareholders cannot consider the CNOOC bid until after Aug. 10, when they are scheduled to vote on Chevron's offer, Robertson said. If Chevron is rejected, then CNOOC would begin its regulatory process and security review.</p>              <p>   ""They're in for a long and drawn-out process,"" Robertson said.</p>              <p>   But Mark Palmer of Public Opinion Strategies said the process would be faster than Chevron depicts. A CFIUS review that finds no threat to national security in a foreign takeover can take less than 30 days, and there is precedent for the process to begin before a takeover bid is formally accepted, he said.</p>              <p>   ""We want to provide timing and certainty to Unocal stockholders for our superior offer,"" Palmer said, ""and we want the committee to begin the process as soon as possible.""</p>                      "

Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick (D-Mich.), author of a House amendment, approved last week 333 to 92, that would cut off funds for a federal security review needed to allow the deal to proceed. ""We're a democracy. We're not communists.""</p>              <p>   ""At the very least, they have solidified  --  if not exacerbated  --  concerns of members of Congress here, by telling Congress to butt out,"" said Brian Kennedy, a spokesman for Rep. Richard W. Pombo (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Resources Committee. Pombo was co- author of a resolution, passed 398 to 15, expressing concern that the takeover bid could threaten national security.</p>              <p>   Since CNOOC made its unsolicited, $18.5 billion bid for Unocal, CNOOC officials and their representatives in the United States have been careful to distance the company from the Chinese government and to paint the transaction as purely a business venture. But the Chinese Foreign Ministry upset that orchestration Monday with a prepared, strongly worded statement addressed directly to Congress.</p>              <p>   ""We demand that the U.S. Congress correct its mistaken ways of politicizing economic and trade issues and stop interfering in the normal commercial exchanges between enterprises of the two countries,"" the ministry wrote. ""CNOOC's bid to take over the U.S. Unocal company is a normal commercial activity between enterprises and should not fall victim to political interference.""</p>              <p>   Many members of Congress view CNOOC's bid as anything but ""a normal commercial activity."" Unocal's board of directors had already accepted a $16.5 billion bid in cash and stock from a U.S. oil company, Chevron Corp., and CNOOC's unsolicited entry coincided with China's very public efforts to secure energy reserves for its rapidly rising demand. Anti-Chinese sentiment in Congress has been building for several years over charges of currency manipulation, intellectual property theft and other unfair trade practices.</p>              <p>   Chevron, in turn, has stoked those fears with its own lobbying effort, designed to link CNOOC to Chinese government policy aims. Officials at Chevron, the nation's second-largest oil company, have portrayed their efforts to buy Unocal as a David fighting the unlimited resources of the Chinese government's Goliath.</p>              <p>   ""This is a government buying a commercial company and moving probable [oil and gas] reserves from the market to government holdings,"" Peter J. Robertson, Chevron's vice chairman, said in an interview last week. ""This is not free trade. This is unfair trade.""</p>              <p>   By demanding that the House repudiate its votes, the Chinese government may have played into Chevron's hands. ""I don't think 333 people who represent millions of Americans all over this country made a mistake,"" Kilpatrick said. ""They knew exactly what they were doing.""</p>              <p>   ""When the Chinese government acts like they do nothing wrong and they can rattle a saber at everyone, they are not helping their cause,"" said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), co-author of a bill that would slap steep tariffs on Chinese goods if the government fails to revalue its currency.</p>              <p>   And Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), the longest-serving current member of the House, plans to announce today the reintroduction of another bill that would crack down on currency manipulation</p>              <p>   Wall Street also viewed the Chinese statement as potentially damaging. ""CNOOC now probably has to do a significant public relations blitz and open up its books and show that they do in fact operate independently,"" said Jeb S. Armstrong, energy analyst at Argus Research Co. ""But that's probably not going to happen.""</p>              <p>   Chevron stock rose $1.59to $58.56 a share  yesterday, perhaps reflecting investor belief that the Chinese statement strengthened Chevron's hand and lessened chances that the company will have to significantly increase its offer. The increase in the stock price pushed the value of Chevron's bid to $16.7 billion.</p>              <p>   Officials at Public Strategies Inc., which is handling public relations for CNOOC, would not comment on the Chinese Foreign Ministry statement. But officials in Washington and New York who are close to CNOOC said the government had made their already difficult job considerably more challenging.</p>              <p>   Bush administration officials were not surprised by the statement, however. For several months, administration officials have warned China that they could hold off anti-China sentiments for only so long. If the government fails to respond to trade concerns, eventually Congress will act. But Chinese officials have repeatedly showed their belief that Congress is more beholden to White House wishes than in fact it is, administration officials say.</p>              <p>   Staff writer Ben White contributed to this report.</p>                      "

The company, owned by the United Arab Emirates city-state of Dubai, had agreed to buy Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation, a venerable British firm that manages port terminals in 19 countries, including facilities in New York, Baltimore, New Orleans and other U.S. cities.</p>              <p>   While the deal had attracted little attention for months and had even won approval from an interagency panel, it suddenly blossomed into controversy over national security and foreign ownership of U.S. assets.</p>              <p>   Hypocrisy and short-sightedness were rife on both sides of the fight, which promises to carry over into this week with a bipartisan group in Congress threatening legislation to block or delay the deal.</p>              <p>   But so far, Dubai Ports World has escaped much of the criticism. Officials at the fast-growing company claimed to be shocked  --  shocked  --  that their deal, which moved ahead for months with little notice, had ignited such a fierce battle on the eve of its completion.</p>              <p>   Had they never heard of Cnooc? Shouldn't they have known they were sticking their head in a hornets' nest? Could they really be surprised that facts rarely get in the way of a good election-year food fight?</p>              <p>   Executives and bankers for Cnooc, the Chinese oil company, expressed similar surprise last year when their bid to buy Unocal touched off a political frenzy that ultimately killed the proposed deal. The two cases are not precisely parallel because Unocal already had a good offer on the table from Chevron before Cnooc came calling. So it was always going to be an uphill battle for the Chinese.</p>              <p>   But the political tin ear displayed by both companies is similar. Cnooc, apparently, could not understand why its offer would stoke fears of a rising China's thirst for oil. Dubai Ports World, apparently, believed its purchase wouldn't turn into a proxy for debates over port security and direct foreign investment. The company didn't realize it was serving up a fat pitch for Democrats enraged at always winding up on the losing side of the antiterror issue.</p>              <p>   Couldn't Dubai Ports World have requested a full, 45-day national security review to assuage fears? Couldn't it have gone to the Hill earlier to explain how it has little role in port security, how it pretty much just loads and unloads ships? By late Thursday, the company was finally getting its political sea legs, agreeing to delay its takeover of U.S. terminals until Congress gets comfortable. That might be enough. But did it have to come to this?</p>                      "

South Carolina has also led the fight against outsourcing of jobs overseas. But in recent years the opposite has occurred: Chinese companies have invested in South Carolina  --  albeit on limited terms.</p>              <p>Haier, a Chinese appliance maker, has a refrigerator factory in the state. There's also a Chinese-owned chemical factory, printing company and general construction company, among others, that in total employ thousands of South Carolinians, according to John X. Ling, the state's representative in China.</p>              <p>The low cost of land, cheaper than in China's major cities, and electricity  --  which tends to be about a third or a fourth the cost in China  --  are attractions. So is the idea of being closer to American consumers, their primary customers.</p>              <p>Zhou, 54, who purchased the auto refurbishing company in Spartanburg, said another factor has to do with politics.</p>              <p>""We look at the example of the Japanese company Honda. . . .

When U.S. business delegations come to China seeking investments, Wenzhou is a popular stop.</p>              <p>Guanshen Auto is a leading supplier of constant-velocity axles, which transfer power from a vehicle's transmission to its wheels. Lovely's company, Powerline, refurbished old CV axles and sold them.</p>              <p>Zhou made his initial purchase of a stake in Powerline in 2005, a few months after the Chinese government did away with its currency's long-held peg to the dollar and its value began to rise. As the dollar continued to weaken in 2007, Zhou bought more of the company, renaming it GSP North America after the Chinese initials of the parent company. After having paid a total $1.3 million, Zhou now owns 85 percent of the South Carolina factory.</p>              <p>He said that the factory employees were apprehensive about working for a Chinese company. ""People objected. When we went to visit the factory, American workers said, 'We work for Chinese now. We don't have face,' "" Zhou recalled.</p>              <p>Lovely, who remains chief operating officer of the company and still owns 15 percent, himself was apprehensive. ""People said, 'You're very gutsy to do that.' . . . It was hard for other people to understand. People think there's no law over there"" in China, he said.</p>              <p>Dick Adams, 57, whom Zhou hired to be in charge of sales and marketing at GSP North America, said the company is proving to employees, the community and the state of South Carolina that they are ""good Chinese.""</p>              <p>When Zhou took over, he initially operated the factory Chinese-style, 24 hours a day  --  with a day shift and a graveyard shift. But the workers complained about working in the middle of the night, so now the factory just keeps regular daytime hours.</p>              <p>""You have Chinese that come in here and just want to take, take, take and not give anything. They'll come in here just to get an order and run away. GSP hasn't done that.

"278","2009-11-07","Chinese company to buy a stake in AES; Arlington firm seeks money for new projects, ties to Asia","410329594","The Washington Post","A.20","            >                                        >                          <p>AES, the Arlington-based power generating company, said Friday it would raise $2.2 billion for new projects by selling 15 percent of its stock and more than a third of its wind-generation business to a unit of China's sovereign wealth fund.</p>              <p>AES said that by turning to the China Investment Corp. for funds it would be able to move ahead with projects in its development pipeline without weakening its balance sheet, and build a relationship that could bolster its prospects in a key growth market.</p>              <p>Paul Hanrahan, AES chief executive, said in an interview that the deal ""takes the company from one that is in stable financial condition but can't do much to grow"" to one that can ""start funding the projects in our pipeline,"" including 1,200 megawatts of U.S. wind projects. He added that it would also give the company ""dry powder"" for acquisitions. </p>              <p>For CIC, the investment represents further diversification and a continuing strategy of taking minority stakes in companies. Established in 2007 with $200 billion to invest, CIC bought chunks of Blackstone and Morgan Stanley just months before the financial crisis erased much of their value. More recently, it has acquired stakes in a British real estate developer, a Canadian company involved in coal mining in Mongolia, Russian and Kazakh oil companies, and an Indonesian energy firm. It has also made further investments in hedge funds. </p>              <p>AES said CIC would buy a 15 percent stake in the company by purchasing 125.5 million shares of AES stock at $12.60 a share for a total of $1.58 billion, representing a discount on the current price. (AES closed Friday at $14.03 a share, up 17 cents, or 1.2 percent.) CIC will nominate one member to the 10-person AES board of directors. </p>              <p>In addition, CIC signed a letter of intent to pay an additional $571 million for a 35 percent interest in AES's wind-generation business. It will make additional investments proportional to its stake as the business finds new projects. </p>              <p>In an earnings conference call, several analysts questioned the deal, noting that just last year AES asserted that its stock was undervalued and bought back shares at $14 each. They said AES would be under pressure to show that its projects would be profitable enough to justify diluting the stock of current shareholders. </p>              <p>""This sets a high bar for us,"" Hanrahan said, adding that ""we have to demonstrate that we'll be able to take this money and turn it into value for the shareholders."" </p>              <p>Hanrahan said AES, which operates in 29 countries, has 1,200 megawatts of new wind projects that will require about $600 million in equity over the next 18 months. He said AES will need another $600 million for other power projects during the same time period. </p>              <p>The link with CIC might help AES in a variety of ways, Hanrahan said, including new opportunities in Asia. CIC receives about 100 business proposals a day, according to a person in Beijing who has been involved in negotiating transactions there. Hanrahan told analysts that the CIC investment might also help secure Chinese export financing for Chinese-made equipment in a Vietnam project. </p>              <p>The deal does not set any requirements on where AES would purchase wind turbines, Hanrahan said, unlike a recently announced $1.5 billion Chinese investment in a Texas project that will use turbines made in China. In the short term, he expects the Chinese investment will help AES push ahead with projects that rely on U.S.-made wind turbines. </p>              <p>""We have a lot of projects in development,"" Hanrahan said, ""and the market said, 'Where are you going to get the money from?' ""</p>              <p>AES will seek approval for the deal from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an inter-agency group that reviews national security dimensions of foreign investments, Hanrahan said. But AES said it does not expect a problem because CIC would not have control over AES and because the power plant technology in question does not pose any issue. </p>              <p>mufsons@washpost.com</p>                      "

Unocal's stock jumped nearly 8% on the report, its biggest daily gain in nearly six years.</p>              <p>   CNOOC Ltd., an arm of China's state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp., is mainly interested in Unocal's exploration and production in Asia, the Financial Times reported on its website Thursday.</p>              <p>   Unocal spokesman Barry Lane declined to comment. Xiao Zongwei, a spokesman for CNOOC, China's third-largest oil company, also refused to comment.</p>              <p>   Unocal's Asian assets are attractive to international oil companies, which could prompt a bidding fight if CNOOC emerges with an offer, said Jason Putman, an analyst at Victory Capital Management, which owns more than 6 million Unocal shares.</p>              <p>   ""I think Unocal has a lot of potential buyers,"" he said. ""That's one of the reasons we like Unocal.""</p>              <p>   Another reason that bidders might surface now is Unocal's settlement last month of human-rights lawsuits related to its partial ownership of a $1.2-billion natural gas pipeline in Myanmar. The case posed a potential liability to a would-be buyer if Unocal had lost.</p>              <p>   However, at least one analyst, Bruce Lanni of A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc., was skeptical.</p>              <p>   In a note to clients, Lanni said he was visiting Unocal Chief Executive Charles Williamson and other top executives when the reports surfaced. Although ""they did not comment,"" Lanni wrote, ""it appeared to us that there was little validity to the speculation.""</p>              <p>   Formerly called Union Oil Co. of California, Unocal was founded in 1890 in Santa Paula in Ventura County. It has oil and natural gas projects in such countries as Indonesia, Thailand and Bangladesh, and operates in the Gulf of Mexico and in such U.S. regions as Texas' Permian Basin.</p>              <p>   With 6,600 employees, Unocal once owned the Union 76 gasoline brand but sold it in 1997 to focus on exploration and production.</p>              <p>   Like other oil companies, Unocal saw its earnings and revenue shoot up last year as crude oil prices hit record highs. Unocal's revenue in 2003 was $6.5 billion, but its 2004 revenue -- which hasn't yet been reported -- is expected to show an increase of at least $1 billion. Industry leader Exxon Mobil Corp. had 2003 revenue of $247 billion.</p>              <p>   A buyout offer from a Chinese company wouldn't be surprising because the nation's booming economy, bulging trade surplus and growing energy demands are prompting China to look overseas for energy assets and other properties, analysts said.</p>              <p>   Last month, for instance, China's biggest computer maker, Lenovo Group Ltd., acquired  IBM Corp.'s personal computer business for $1.25 billion. That was one of China's biggest foreign acquisitions ever, and analysts said that more deals were sure to follow.</p>              <p>   Takeover rumors about Unocal are nothing new. The company has fought off three previous hostile bids in its 115-year history.</p>              <p>   ""Unocal has been a prospective takeover candidate for the past several years,"" said Aliza Fan, senior analyst at John S. Herold Inc., an industry consulting firm.</p>              <p>   That's mainly because Unocal is a relatively small, independent player whose stock has lagged behind the industry for an extended period of time, Fan said.</p>              <p>   The Asian projects that could appeal to a buyer ""will not come to fruition for many years,"" she said. ""So investors have been unwilling to give credit to Unocal for some of its long-term potential in Asia.""</p>              <p>   Whether CNOOC or another suitor would be more patient and make a formal offer for Unocal, or at least for its Asian assets, remains to be seen. CNOOC's interest is at an early stage and no talks have been held, unnamed sources told the Financial Times.</p>              <p>   Reuters News Service quoted anonymous sources as saying CNOOC was eyeing several foreign oil companies.</p>              <p>   Unocal fought off its last major takeover attempt 20 years ago, when it foiled a bid by corporate raider T. Boone Pickens Jr. But the episode saddled Unocal with billions of dollars in additional debt, and it wasn't until the mid-1990s that Unocal fully recovered - - in good part by expanding into Asia.</p>              <p>   On Thursday, Unocal's stock climbed $3.15, or 7.7%, to $44.34 on the New York Stock Exchange. That gave Unocal a total market value of $11.7 billion.</p>              <p>   CNOOC's New York-traded shares rose 54 cents to $51.85.</p>              <p>   Times staff writer Ching-Ching Ni in Beijing contributed to this report.</p>              <p> Credit: Times Staff Writer</p>                      "

Chevron agreed to pay $62 a share in cash and stock for Unocal.</p>              <p>   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, CNOOC said it was ""continuing to examine its options with respect to Unocal,"" which might ""include a possible offer.""</p>              <p>   But CNOOC said no decision had been made. Such an offer would by far be the largest acquisition ever attempted by a Chinese company.</p>              <p>   Chevron spokesman Don Campbell said ""it's inappropriate for us to comment on the possible actions of others."" But, he said, ""we believe our offer, accepted by the Unocal board, is attractive and has a high degree of certainty as to completion.""</p>              <p>   Asked whether Chevron would make a counter-bid to any CNOOC offer, he declined to comment. Unocal spokesman Barry Lane also had no comment.</p>              <p>   Investors reacted cautiously to CNOOC's statement. Unocal's stock rose 61 cents, or 1.1%, to $58.10 a share, while Chevron slipped 7 cents to $54.78. CNOOC's American depositary receipts, which are similar to shares of stock for U.S. trading, fell 31 cents to $55.46 apiece.</p>              <p>   Several of Unocal's major oil and natural gas projects are in the Asia Pacific region and the Gulf of Mexico, and about 66% of its sales come from foreign sites. Chevron also operates in those areas, and it bid for Unocal in part because it expects to save $325 million a year in operating efficiencies once the companies are joined.</p>              <p>   But with China now the world's fastest-growing major economy and its demand for oil second only to the United States, CNOOC and the rest of China's oil industry are under pressure to find or acquire additional reserves.</p>              <p>   Even so, some analysts said they doubted CNOOC would make an offer for Unocal because it faced several obstacles, including intense U.S. regulatory scrutiny and a likely bidding war with giant Chevron, which had sales of $155.3 billion in 2004. Acquiring Unocal would increase Chevron's oil and natural gas reserves by about 15%, to the equivalent of 13 billion barrels of oil.</p>              <p>   ""While it's possible, I don't think it's probable,"" said Derek Butter, head of corporate analysis at the Edinburgh, Scotland, office of Wood Mackenzie, an investment firm that focuses on the energy sector.</p>              <p>   He noted that the Unocal-Chevron deal included a major deterrent in the form of a ""break-up fee,"" in which any other acquirer of Unocal would have to pay $500 million to Chevron. And if CNOOC offered stock as part of its bid, Unocal's investors might object to the offer because of political risks associated with China, he said.</p>              <p>   ""The Unocal shareholders are perfectly happy to hold Chevron paper [stock] and take some of it in cash,"" Butter said. ""But Unocal's shareholders would be less inclined to hold CNOOC paper, so CNOOC would have to top Chevron with an all-cash bid.""</p>              <p>   If CNOOC did that, ""our main concern would be that [CNOOC] overpays"" for Unocal to prevail over Chevron, Lorraine Tan, an equity analyst for Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., said in a note to clients.</p>              <p>   There reportedly is division within CNOOC about Unocal. The Chinese company's nonexecutive directors have delayed its senior managers' efforts to launch a bid, with both sides hiring separate investment advisors to evaluate the proposal, the Financial Times has reported.</p>              <p>   But the Chinese clearly have their eyes on overseas expansion.</p>              <p>   In April, China National Offshore Oil bought a 17% stake in MEG Energy Corp. in Canada, and last month another state-owned oil firm, Sinopec, acquired a 40% interest in a $4.5-billion oil sands project in Alberta, Canada.</p>              <p>   One of the biggest foreign acquisitions by a Chinese company was the $1.25-billion purchase of IBM Corp.'s personal computer business by Lenovo Group, China's largest computer maker, which was completed in May.</p>              <p>   Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman declined to say Tuesday whether the Bush administration would try to block a CNOOC takeover of Unocal.</p>              <p>   ""We were very pleased with the fact that Chevron stepped up and paid the price and was the winning bidder for Unocal,"" he told Bloomberg News.</p>              <p>   Unocal was founded 115 years ago as Union Oil Co. of California in Santa Paula in Ventura County. With Chevron, it became a major player in California's energy markets during the 20th century and was known for its Union 76 brand of gasoline.</p>              <p>   But Unocal shed its retail, marketing and refining operations in 1997 to focus on exploration and production.

In fact, TCL combined its TV operation with Thomson's TV operation, not with all of Thomson. The deal did not include TCL's DVD division.</p>              <p>   As a graduate student in Japan in the mid-1980s, Wenran Jiang marveled at how Sony, Panasonic, Toshiba and others proudly marched into the U.S., establishing well-respected brand names and buying landmarks like Rockefeller Center in New York and Columbia Pictures in Hollywood.</p>              <p>   Jiang, a native of the industrial city of Harbin in northeast China, never imagined that companies in his motherland would undertake such global expansion.</p>              <p>   Now, it appears, that moment has come.</p>              <p>   China's Lenovo Group said it was buying the personal computer business of IBM Corp., an American icon that had pioneered the PC market. The $1.25-billion purchase would catapult Lenovo -- virtually unknown outside of China -- into the world's third- largest seller of PCs, giving it an internationally recognized brand and access to IBM's technical and management capabilities.</p>              <p>   More than that, in the eyes of many Chinese and others around the globe, the Lenovo-IBM deal represents a watershed in the Asian nation's rise as a global economic power, moving beyond just churning out cheap goods from low-wage factories.</p>              <p>   ""This is a new Chinese business model emerging,"" said Jiang, an associate professor at the University of Alberta in Canada. ""It shows there is an integrated strategy that in order to break into the world markets, you have to be brand conscious, build up domestic production and dare to buy and expand.""</p>              <p>   The Chinese want to possess quality brands in a host of products, including consumer electronics, home appliances, software and automobiles. And flush with U.S. dollars from their booming exports to America, the Chinese are looking to buy their way to world-class economic status.</p>              <p>   Early this year, China's TCL Group combined its television and DVD operations with French company Thomson to create the world's leading maker of televisions, built around the RCA brand.</p>              <p>   Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp., China's top automaker and a partner of General Motors Corp., agreed in October to buy a controlling stake in South Korea's Ssangyong Motor Co. and is in talks with Britain's MG Rover Group Ltd. The goal: to gain footholds in overseas markets and produce at least 50,000 vehicles with its own distinctive moniker by 2007.</p>              <p>   Appliance makers Haier Group and Kelong Corp. are seeking entrance into the U.S. market by building their own sales networks or buying well-known brand names. Haier has a refrigerator plant in Camden, S.C., and a New York sales office in midtown Manhattan.</p>              <p>   Said Gao Yingjun, a manager at medicine exporter Tong Ren Tang: ""Previously our slogan was 'Where there is Chinese, there is Tong Ren Tang.' Now it's: 'Where there are Westerners, there is Tong Ren Tang.' ""</p>              <p>   Lenovo's plan to purchase IBM's PC business carries huge symbolism and potential ramifications. Unlike the expansion of Japanese electronic firms, which painstakingly built up their own brands, Lenovo is looking to seize foreign markets and close the technical and business gap with rivals in developed countries much more quickly.</p>              <p>   ""It's a very big opportunity for China,"" said Yoshitaka Okada, a professor at Sophia University in Tokyo and an expert in Japan's electronics industry.</p>              <p>   The strategy is fraught with risk, he noted. About half of all mergers and acquisitions fail, Okada said, and it's unclear how well Lenovo, which is partly owned by the Chinese government, can maintain brand quality.</p>              <p>   Some IBM dealers in China said the marriage would dilute the IBM brand and hurt its sales in the Asian nation. ""Customers might hesitate to buy an IBM in the short term, worried that the quality of the computers might decrease,"" said Liu Qinhua, a salesman at an IBM ThinkPad shop in Shanghai.</p>              <p>   But the potential reward is huge. Success at Lenovo could elevate it, and other Chinese companies that follow its lead, into the next stage of development. Many in China's high-tech industry, sharing such hopes, were exuberant Wednesday.</p>              <p>   ""It's a very proud thing,"" said Li Kan, general manager of ISoftStone Technologies Ltd. in Shanghai, which was buzzing when news spread through the office about Lenovo's acquisition. The software company, based in Beijing, has a sales office in Boston and is looking to expand in the U.S. and Asian markets through partnerships.</p>              <p>   ""One day,"" Li said, ""many, many more Chinese companies will play an important role in the world. This is the first big one.""</p>              <p>   At the same time, with the aid of massive foreign investment, the Chinese are also trying to hatch their own brands and develop capabilities to produce such high-tech goods as semiconductors and telecommunications equipment. One factor in China's favor: It has a huge bankroll to finance purchases.</p>              <p>   Thanks to its trade surplus with the U.S., largely due to sales of low-tech products such as toys, bags and shoes, China has amassed foreign reserves of $540 billion. And instead of just spending the money on U.S. Treasury bills, the Chinese are scouring for productive assets around the world.</p>              <p>   The international push comes after 25 years of market reform, which has vastly improved people's living standards and created some of the most dynamic cities and companies anywhere. But there are questions about whether the Chinese have developed the sophisticated management know-how needed to compete globally.</p>              <p>   The recent scandal involving Chinese-owned China Aviation Oil (Singapore) Corp., which is reeling from losses of as much as $550 million from trading in derivatives related to oil investments, has heightened concerns about China's corporate governance practices.</p>              <p>   Others have derided China's role in the world as a ""carrier economy,"" merely a producer and handler of goods for foreign multinationals. For example, by some measures, the Chinese are already the world's leading exporter of computers. But they are cheap models and command little if any premium.</p>              <p>   Just as the Japanese expansion in the 1970s and '80s drew criticism abroad, the Chinese are almost certain to stir resentment as they go on a shopping spree and exert new economic power.</p>              <p>   In Canada, China's state-owned Minimetals' proposal to pay about $5 billion for Canada's largest mining company, Noranda Inc., has generated vigorous debate about what a takeover by the Chinese would mean for miners' jobs.</p>              <p>   In September, in the shoe-producing town of Elche, Spain, some 500 demonstrators set fire to Chinese-owned warehouses and demanded that the Spanish government restrict imports of shoes.</p>              <p>   But China may not feel the intensity of emotion that the Japanese engendered two decades ago in America. For one thing, China is making its global foray while also opening its own markets wider to foreigners. Chinese companies also appear more interested in gaining access and learning rather than imposing their management techniques or way of doing business in other lands.</p>              <p>   Nor is the purchase a pure capitalistic move to enhance profit immediately; IBM's PC division was losing money. Moreover, Lenovo agreed to keep the business based in the United States and run by the current management team, with IBM holding a 19% stake in Lenovo.</p>              <p>   ""That's important because it's a clear indication that one of the things China is buying is expertise,"" said Donald Straszheim, chairman of Los Angeles-based Straszheim Global Advisors, which has offices in Beijing and Shenzhen, China. ""China knows that they don't know how to run a company like this and how to navigate an American economy.""</p>              <p>   Straszheim said he expected many more Chinese companies, high- and low-tech, to be swooping up established names.

"282","2005-01-17","CALIFORNIA; Unocal Eyed for Takeover; Suitors reportedly are circling the firm, whose assets offer access to oil and natural gas reserves.","421979460","Los Angeles Times","C.1","            >                                        >                          <p>   Perennial bridesmaid Unocal Corp. has been a rumored takeover target for years, yet it has remained independent as other major oil companies consolidated.</p>              <p>   Now there's fresh speculation that one or more suitors are circling the El Segundo-based company and that, this time, it might actually get hitched.</p>              <p>   A confluence of changes in the oil industry and at Unocal -- including a rebound in its prospects, especially in Asia and the Gulf of Mexico -- make the company especially attractive, analysts said.</p>              <p>   ""There's more meat on this bone than at any time before,"" said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York.</p>              <p>   With global energy demand soaring and supplies ever harder to find, Unocal offers immediate access to oil and natural gas reserves, especially in Asia, Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>              <p>   Unocal's moderate size also makes it relatively easy to swallow for the world's major oil companies, which are flush with cash and enjoying high stock prices because petroleum and its products are so expensive. Unocal's 2004 revenue, which hasn't yet been reported, probably was about $7.5 billion to $8 billion.</p>              <p>   In turn, Unocal -- which has fought off three hostile bids in its 115-year history, the most recent in 1985 -- might be more receptive to a buyout, analysts said.</p>              <p>   Unocal's stock performance has long lagged behind that of its peers. But it has traded near a 10-year peak lately because of rising oil prices and probably would fetch a premium in a takeover.</p>              <p>   ""If you're a Unocal shareholder or a director, it might be the best time [to sell] that you can get,"" said a source familiar with Unocal's operations. Unocal executives declined to comment.</p>              <p>   Unocal shares Friday rose 19 cents to $46.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock rose 17.4% last year, but the oil group's average gain was double that at 34.4%, Gheit said.</p>              <p>   Among those taking a close look at Unocal are China National Offshore Oil Corp., a state-controlled operator known as CNOOC, and Royal Dutch/Shell Group, according to published reports.</p>              <p>   CNOOC reportedly was weighing a bid of about $13 billion; Unocal's current stock market value is $12.2 billion.</p>              <p>   Formerly called Union Oil Co. of California, Unocal was founded in 1890 in Santa Paula and was a leading player in California's oil and gasoline markets until the mid-1990s.</p>              <p>   That's when it shed the last of its California oil fields and sold its Union 76 gasoline business to focus on exploration and production in other regions, especially overseas. It now employs 6,600 people and is the seventh-largest U.S.-based oil company by revenue, according to industry researcher Energy Intelligence Group Inc.</p>              <p>   As the 21st century arrived, Unocal was struggling to grow. Its exploration efforts had produced mixed results. Its stock trailed those of other oil companies. Its investors were frustrated.</p>              <p>   But Unocal doggedly pursued an ambitious exploration plan that included deep-water wells in Asia and the Gulf of Mexico, which are starting to pay off. The company also shed some of its less- profitable North American assets to shore up its domestic profitability. As a result, about 66% of Unocal's production now comes from foreign sites.</p>              <p>   Through the first nine months of last year, Unocal's profit more than doubled to $940 million from $463 million for the same period in 2003, aided by crude prices that hit record highs. Unocal's nine- month revenue jumped 20% to $5.9 billion.</p>              <p>   Unocal's average daily production of oil and natural gas in last year's third quarter -- the most recent figure available -- was the equivalent of about 407,000 barrels a day, and that's expected to climb 6% to 430,000 during 2005, Value Line Investment Survey estimates.</p>              <p>   CNOOC is said to be especially interested in Unocal's Asian assets, which include properties in Indonesia, Thailand, Bangladesh and Myanmar.</p>              <p>   Unocal's West Seno field in deep water off Indonesia is particularly attractive, producing an average of 40,000 barrels of oil daily, up from 20,000 early in 2004.</p>              <p>   Unocal also has a 10.3% interest in a Caspian Sea field being developed for Azerbaijan. The project's average daily production this year is expected to rise to 200,000 barrels a day from 140,000 in 2004.</p>              <p>   The properties' locations are appealing largely because of the continued rise in Asian demand for oil and natural gas, said Aliza Fan, senior analyst in Houston for John S. Herold Inc., a consulting company.</p>              <p>   Unocal also has natural gas fields in Alaska and operations in Vietnam, the North Sea, Canada and Texas' Permian Basin.</p>              <p>   It's also active in the Gulf of Mexico. It has a 15.6% interest in one deep-water project there, dubbed Mad Dog, that's expected to produce its first oil next month. Unocal has said it hopes several other projects in the gulf will come online by 2010.</p>              <p>   But one source close to Unocal said the Chinese -- their economy booming and thirst for oil growing rapidly -- weren't looking at Unocal simply in terms of its Asian properties. China wants oil and gas reserves badly enough to look at South America and the reopening of Libya's oil fields to foreign companies, among other prospects.</p>              <p>   The Chinese ""need to import a lot of oil for their growing industry, and they're sending their national oil companies far afield,"" the source said.</p>              <p>   The United States could be a difficult frontier.</p>              <p>   If the Chinese did buy Unocal, ""it's very unlikely in my view that they would keep any of Unocal's U.S. operations,"" Gheit said. The United States ""is virgin territory for them, and would subject them to all the U.S. rules and regulations. They want to stay away from Washington.""</p>              <p>   If acquired, Unocal would provide the buyer with another potentially lucrative asset: Unocal's patents on cleaner-burning gasoline sold in California.</p>              <p>   In the early 1990s, Unocal helped develop a standard for the cleaner fuel while also securing patents on various gasoline recipes. Although Unocal sold its refineries and service stations, it held on to the gasoline patents.</p>              <p>   Other oil companies, which would have to pay royalties to Unocal, have repeatedly challenged the patents in court, but they remain in force.</p>              <p>   The Federal Trade Commission last fall also reinstated civil antitrust charges against the company, alleging that the patents gave Unocal ""unlawful market power"" to demand the royalties. Unocal denies that claim.</p>              <p>   The FTC claims that the patent royalties would saddle California consumers with an additional $500 million a year in pump prices. Unocal's estimate of annual royalties ranges from $75 million to $150 million.</p>              <p>   *</p>              <p>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</p>              <p>   At a glance</p>              <p>   Unocal Corp.</p>              <p>   Headquarters: El Segundo</p>              <p>   Type: public</p>              <p>   Founded: 1890</p>              <p>   Employees: 6,600</p>              <p>   Revenue: $6.5 billion</p>              <p>   Net income: $643 million</p>              <p>   Oil and gas reserves: equivalent</p>              <p>   to 1.76 billion barrels</p>              <p>   Production: equivalent to</p>              <p>   448,200 barrels a day</p>              <p>   CNOOC Ltd.</p>              <p>   Headquarters: Hong Kong</p>              <p>   Type: public subsidiary of</p>              <p>   China National Offshore Oil</p>              <p>   Corp. of Beijing</p>              <p>   Founded: 1999</p>              <p>   Employees: 2,450</p>              <p>   Revenue: $4.9 billion</p>              <p>   Net income: $1.4 billion</p>              <p>   Oil and gas reserves: equivalent</p>              <p>   to 2.1 billion barrels</p>              <p>   Production: equivalent to</p>              <p>   356,729 barrels a day</p>              <p>   All figures are for 2003; production figures include natural gas.</p>              <p>   Sources: company reports, Bloomberg News, Times research</p>              <p>   Los Angeles Times</p>              <div><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""41""/><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""Illustration""/><div class=""Illustration_content""><p>Caption: PHOTO: HEADQUARTERS: Unocal's offices in El Segundo.

"283","2005-06-11","Patent Accord Clears Way for Sale of Unocal; The Chevron deal wins FTC backing after the oil firms agree to give up royalties that could have cost drivers in California $500 million a year.","421981758","Los Angeles Times","C.1","            >                                        >                          <p>   U.S. regulators, claiming a victory for California motorists, approved Chevron Corp.'s proposed $16.4-billion purchase of Unocal Corp. on Friday after the companies agreed to surrender Unocal's long-contested patents on the state's cleaner-burning gasoline.</p>              <p>   The Federal Trade Commission said the pact would save California drivers as much as $500 million a year because competitors would not have to pay royalties to Unocal and, eventually, to Chevron for making the reformulated gasoline -- royalties that would have been passed on to drivers.</p>              <p>   That would average about 3 cents a gallon, as California consumes nearly 16 billion gallons of gasoline a year.</p>              <p>   ""This is an important event"" for the state's gasoline market, said David Hackett, president of Stillwater Associates, an industry consulting firm in Irvine.</p>              <p>   The settlement also is a major step in Chevron's bid to complete the purchase of El Segundo-based Unocal, which had vigorously defended its patents and denied wrongdoing.</p>              <p>   The companies announced their deal April 4, with Chevron, based in San Ramon, Calif., agreeing to pay about $62 in cash and stock for each Unocal share. The acquisition, which still must be approved by Unocal's stockholders, is expected to be completed this year.</p>              <p>   A Chinese oil company, CNOOC Ltd., said Tuesday that it also was mulling a takeover offer for Unocal that could potentially spark a bidding war for the company. But CNOOC, a division of state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp., has yet to make a formal offer.</p>              <p>   The FTC, which already had filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against Unocal over the gasoline patents, said it had been prepared to challenge the Chevron purchase on the basis of the five patents.</p>              <p>   The settlement is a ""victory for California consumers,"" the FTC said in a statement, adding that the agency had no other antitrust- related concerns about the proposed merger.</p>              <p>   The FTC's suit would be dropped under the agreement. In turn, Unocal and Chevron agreed to ""cease and desist from any and all efforts"" to enforce the patents or collect royalties on them, and instead will ""release all relevant gasoline patents to the public,"" according to their consent decree.</p>              <p>   Unocal and Chevron also agreed to dismiss all pending patent- related lawsuits that included legal battles between Unocal and other oil companies. Much of that litigation was effectively on hold pending the outcome of the FTC case.</p>              <p>   The agreement was praised by Unocal's competitors and by state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, who had helped the FTC oppose the patents. ""No drivers need more relief at the pump"" than Californians, and ""this agreement helps provide that relief,"" he said in a statement.</p>              <p>   Several of the major oil companies also had opposed the patents, including industry leader Exxon Mobil Corp.; BP, which owns the Arco brand; Shell Oil, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group; and Valero Energy Corp. Chevron itself had fought the patents before reaching the Unocal deal.</p>              <p>   ""We are very gratified by the actions of the FTC,"" Shell said in a statement. BP spokesman Phil Cochrane said his company was ""quite encouraged"" by the deal but was reviewing it before commenting further.</p>              <p>   Unocal, once the owner of the Union 76 brand, in 1997 divested its retail, marketing and refining operations to focus on the exploration and production of oil and natural gas.</p>              <p>   But in the early 1990s, Unocal was one of several companies working with the California Air Resources Board to develop a standard for a cleaner-burning gasoline for the state.</p>              <p>   The FTC, in its initial complaint in March 2003, alleged that Unocal also was simultaneously applying for patents on key aspects of the new fuel but hid that fact from others in the group.</p>              <p>   As a result, Unocal ""illegally acquired monopoly power"" to demand royalties from other refiners selling the new gas, which is now a state-required blend, the FTC contended.</p>              <p>   In refuting the allegations, Unocal has said that the potential royalties from its patents -- and thus the potential cost that motorists would bear -- ranged from $75 million to $150 million, far less than the FTC's $500-million estimate.</p>              <p>   But the patents already cause California motorists to pay about $150 million a year, or slightly less than a penny a gallon, consultant Hackett said.</p>              <p>   That's because some refiners take special steps to make reformulated gasolines that ""avoid the patent restrictions"" but that ""still stay within California's strict guidelines,"" and that adds to the costs passed on to consumers, he said. Hackett is a former Mobil Corp. executive who helped the company, now part of Exxon Mobil, challenge the patents in the 1990s.</p>              <p>   Unocal shares rose 5 cents to $60.24, and Chevron gained 29 cents to $56.30.</p>              <div><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""41""/><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""Illustration""/><div class=""Illustration_content""><p>Caption: PHOTO: DISPUTE: Even Chevron fought Unocal's patents on cleaner-burning gasoline before it offered to buy Unocal.

But a charity Internet auction -- organized by employees -- of about 1,500 of the mementos reaped $19,000 for the Union Rescue Mission in Los Angeles.</p>              <p>   The highest bid was $3,200 for a watercolor of a gas station that was done by California artist Millard Owen Sheets.</p>              <p>   The next big seller was a 9-by-12-inch jade sculpture featuring three elephants, which brought $1,600. The undated piece had been presented to a Unocal executive by a Chinese oil company in the 1980s.</p>              <p>   ""We had an active licensing program for refineries around the world that used our technology,"" said Barry Lane, a spokesman for Unocal who remains at the company.

And there were numerous commemorative pieces from Unocal's centennial celebration 15 years ago.</p>              <p>   Also placed on the block were dishes from the executive dining room at the company's Hartley Research Center in Brea and artwork that hung on the walls of the complex where 1,000 Unocal employees once worked.</p>              <p>   Named after longtime Chief Executive Fred Hartley, who died in 1990, the Hartley center was cleared out in July and demolished. Chevron said Unocal's former headquarters in El Segundo also would be vacated.</p>              <p>   Of Unocal's 6,400 employees at the time of the sale, about 5,000 have been offered jobs by Chevron.

On Wednesday, Chevron's stock dipped 24 cents to $56.76, making the company's Unocal bid worth $60.10 a share.</p>              <p>   Unocal shares fell to $65.20, down 59 cents, while CNOOC's U.S.- traded shares rose 25 cents to $59.25.</p>              <p>   Last week, China's third-largest oil producer launched an $18.5- billion bid for Unocal, an all-cash offer equal to $67 a share. If CNOOC were to supplant Chevron, it would also have to pay that company as much as $500 million in break-up fees.</p>              <p>   ""We remain confident in both the superiority of our offer and the chances of its success,"" CNOOC spokesman Mark Palmer said.</p>              <p>   The CNOOC deal's value is well above the Chevron proposal, but its completion is considered less certain because the company's ties to the Chinese government have sparked opposition from congressional leaders who worry that the oil deal could have national security ramifications.</p>              <p>   Indeed, the CNOOC bid has stirred up a broad and vigorous debate over U.S.-China relations, touching on questions of trade policy, monetary valuations, national security, oil consumption and energy policy. Several members of Congress have urged that the deal be scrutinized by an obscure government entity known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.</p>              <p>   Rep. Carolyn C. Kilpatrick (D-Mich.) on Wednesday offered an amendment to an appropriations bill prohibiting the Treasury Department from recommending that CNOOC be allowed to purchase Unocal, according to a statement from the congresswoman. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow heads the inter-agency foreign investment committee.</p>              <p>   CNOOC has said it welcomes a review by the committee, and has tried to quell fears by pledging to sell Unocal's U.S.-produced oil and natural gas within the country and to keep a substantial number of Unocal's managers and employees. The Hong Kong-based company has hired lobbyists, public relations firms and lawyers to help smooth the way for its Unocal purchase.</p>              <p>   All three companies, meanwhile, are plotting their next moves.</p>              <p>   ""If you're Chevron, you just want to move this along as soon as possible,"" said Jason Putman, an energy analyst at Victory Capital Management, a Cleveland firm that owns more than 7 million shares of Unocal. ""If we have no clarity as to where CNOOC stands with regulators and if everything's the same as it is today, it's tough to turn down the Chevron offer.""</p>              <p>   On the other hand, he said, Unocal's ""trying to get as much time as they can ... and CNOOC has hired a lot of good lobbyists and lawyers. In the next 30 days, a lot could happen.""</p>              <p>   Gene Gillespie, an analyst at Howard Weil, thinks Chevron will have to be cautious.</p>              <p>   ""It's not in Chevron's best interest to get in a bidding war with the Chinese government,"" said Gillespie, whose firm doesn't hold Unocal or Chevron shares.</p>              <p> Credit: Times Staff Writer</p>                      "
"286","2005-07-30","Walk softly and carry less debt; China poses little threat to the United States as long as Washington insists on responsible fiscal policy.","421998374","Los Angeles Times","B.19","            >                                        >                          <p>   By itself, the possible sale of Unocal Corp. to the Chinese firm CNOOC is hardly a big deal. Even if it were to happen (which seems to be growing less likely), Unocal accounts for only a couple tenths of 1% of global oil production.</p>              <p>   But the very idea of such a sale raises a huge question: Despite the substantial benefits provided by trade and international investment, how much American economic interaction with China is too much? At a time when China is the world's most impressive rising economy, yet still an autocratic state with, among other things, a declared willingness to use force against Taiwan under some circumstances, the United States needs to know where to draw the line.</p>              <p>   There are three broad ways by which economic interaction with China could create a strategic threat to the U.S.</p>              <p>   First, China could obtain advanced technologies not otherwise available to it that could increase its military capabilities quickly and dramatically.</p>              <p>   Second, by becoming a critical source of key commodities, China could gain leverage over the U.S. that would allow it to coerce us in a crisis. (It is principally this worry that motivates opponents of Unocal's possible sale to China National Offshore Oil Corp.)</p>              <p>   Third, through design or by happenstance, China could gradually develop a type of economic relationship with the U.S. that would contribute gradually to our own decline, and hence its relative rise in the international pecking order.</p>              <p>   All three of these scenarios deserve to be taken seriously. But, in fact, it is only the last one that should cause the U.S. angst at the moment.</p>              <p>   Consider the other two possibilities first, though. It clearly would be worrisome if China gained from abroad the kinds of advanced military capabilities that it cannot yet build at home. These could include sophisticated command-and-control aircraft and other advanced military communications systems, stealth technologies for planes or submarines, or state-of-the-art supercomputers.</p>              <p>   Unfortunately, Russia is selling some of these kinds of defense systems to China. But for the moment, at least, Europe has retained its ban on arms sales to China, Israel has been dissuaded from further transactions by pressure from Washington, and the U.S. is well prepared to stop such transfers by a combination of export- control laws and the Treasury Department's Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States. The situation clearly bears further vigilance. But in policy terms, our strategy is already clear and already in place.</p>              <p>   The second possible concern relates to the leverage China could wield against the U.S. in a crisis, perhaps dissuading us from coming to Taiwan's defense. In theory, it could do so by dominating production of a necessary industrial good, cutting off the flows of critical natural resources on which our economy depends, or cutting off the flow of dollars by which we are currently financing our budget deficit.</p>              <p>   But in practice, China is not in a strong position to do any of these things, and will not be anytime soon. For instance, though it accounts for about 20% of global computer product production, this is primarily not in top-of-the-line machines. And there are still several other major suppliers that could pick up the slack if Beijing threatened an embargo.</p>              <p>   As for Unocal, the fact is that China still controls much less of the global energy production market than it requires in imports to sustain its own economy. Even with Unocal, most of its oil imports would come from companies owned by others.</p>              <p>   And even in regard to the trade deficit, although China does indeed hold lots of dollars, this is not necessarily a major vulnerability of the United States. There is a form of double jeopardy at work; China now depends on U.S. Treasury bonds as much as we depend on it buying those bonds.</p>              <p>   So the real concern is the last one -- are we gradually becoming a hollow economy, living far beyond our means as we import far more than we export and as we build up huge debt-to-GDP ratios?</p>              <p>   The peril needs to be kept in perspective: China is hardly buying up the United States with the dollars it earns from trade. Its net investment in hard assets in the U.S. as of last year was less than $1 billion, compared with U.S. assets of $15 billion in China.</p>              <p>   But the U.S. net investment position against the rest of the world is indeed worsening, with foreigners now owning about $2.5 trillion more in U.S. assets than we collectively hold abroad. And because of the trade deficit, this figure is increasing by half a trillion dollars a year at present -- still well under 1% of total U.S. assets, but substantial nonetheless.</p>              <p>   The bottom line is clear: We need to reduce our budget and trade deficits, and do so soon.</p>              <p>   Although vigilance about China is always warranted, the proper tool for rebalancing our economic relationship right now is neither tighter investment rules nor protectionism, but U.S. fiscal policy and further Chinese currency reevaluation.</p>              <p>   Michael O'Hanlon is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution</p>                      "

The total amount of the award, which would be paid by Chevron or rival bidder CNOOC Ltd. of China, depends on the final price of the Unocal acquisition.</p>              <p>   The value of Chevron's cash-and-stock bid fluctuates with the price of its shares. Analysts said the San Ramon, Calif.-based oil company had needed to post strong second-quarter results to give its stock a pop -- and boost the value of its Unocal bid, which already was lagging behind CNOOC's.</p>              <p>   Even though Chevron's net income of $1.76 a share beat Wall Street estimates, investors were disappointed that it didn't do better given the blowout results many oil companies have reported this year.</p>              <p>   Chevron's stock slid 93 cents to $58.01, trimming the value of its offer to $63.45 per Unocal share, or $17.28 billion, from $64.02 a share, or $17.44 billion, based on Thursday's closing price.</p>              <p>   CNOOC, whose parent is government-controlled China National Offshore Oil Corp., last month offered to buy Unocal for $18.5 billion, or $67 a share, kicking up a storm of criticism in Washington. CNOOC has resisted pressure to raise its bid, which was rejected by Unocal as being too low given the extra political risk and the regulatory delays a deal probably would entail.</p>              <p>   With Unocal shareholders scheduled to vote Aug. 10 on Chevron's offer, CNOOC must decide in the next few days whether to up its bid.</p>              <p>   Wall Street clearly thinks there's a chance that could happen. Although Unocal's stock fell 35 cents to $64.85 after it, too, released earnings Friday, the closing price was still $1.40 above Chevron's offer.</p>              <p>   ""CNOOC isn't going quietly into that good night,"" said Jeb Armstrong, an oil analyst at Argus Research Corp. ""The question is, how high is CNOOC willing to go?""</p>              <p>   Media reports out of Asia, citing unnamed sources, have been split on whether CNOOC would increase its offer or abandon its pursuit of Unocal. A CNOOC spokesman in China said the company stood by its original offer and was still engaged in the bidding for Unocal. On Friday, CNOOC shares soared in New York trading, jumping $4.61, or more than 7%, to $69.81.</p>              <p>   Meanwhile, Unocal and Chevron executives are visiting some of Unocal's largest shareholders in the coming days to drum up support for Chevron's bid.</p>              <p>   Jason Putman, a managing director of Victory Capital Management, which owns more than 7 million Unocal shares, said he wasn't impressed with Chevron's offer and hoped to see a counter bid from CNOOC.</p>              <p>   ""If a new offer is coming from CNOOC, it's probably coming Monday or Tuesday,"" Putman said. He said the Chevron deal was not in trouble, ""but the stock price puts you in a predicament here. The Chevron offer is below Unocal's stock price.""</p>              <p>   Against this backdrop, Chevron posted second-quarter net income of $3.68 billion, a decline of 11% from a year ago, when profit was boosted by one-time items. Revenue rose 26% to $48.3 billion for the three months ended June 30, bolstered by higher prices for the oil and natural gas the company produces.</p>              <p>   Even though it beat profit estimates, Chevron reported a 6% drop in production from a year ago -- reflecting a troubling trend for the company.</p>              <p>   ""They just haven't been able to effectively replace [oil] reserves,"" said John Leiviska, director of corporate research at bond fund manager Advantus Capital Management Inc. ""If you can't go out and develop reserves, then you go out and buy them,"" he added, alluding to the offer for Unocal.</p>              <p>   Meanwhile, Unocal reported that its second-quarter net income rose 39% to $475 million, or $1.73 a share. Excluding one-time items, profit amounted to $1.77 a share, well above analysts' estimates of $1.63.</p>              <p>   The company's second-quarter revenue rose 19% to $2.21 billion while its output of oil and natural gas jumped 14% over the same quarter in 2004. Unocal also made itself more attractive to an acquirer by boosting its cash balance and by reducing its debt by $190 million to $2.54 billion as of June 30.</p>              <p>   Unocal on Friday also said it had reached a settlement with a group of shareholders who had challenged the Chevron acquisition in court. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Unocal said it agreed to release more information about the buyout negotiations and other matters as part of the settlement.</p>              <p>   Unocal's added disclosures, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, for the first time provided a tally of the bonuses and other compensation to be paid to the company's top officers as part of Unocal's change-of-control plan.

Unocal said Thursday that it would immediately begin talks with CNOOC.</p>              <p>   Among the factors Unocal's directors must assess is whether to give more weight to the Chevron deal because it already is in hand - - and already has received U.S. antitrust clearance -- or to wait for a prolonged U.S. review of the CNOOC proposal and risk its possible rejection.</p>              <p>   Also, CNOOC might be offering more cash today, but the Chevron deal includes Chevron stock that could rise well above $67 a share in future years, analysts said.</p>              <p>   Various court decisions, some stemming from the merger mania of the 1980s, give directors the latitude to turn down a higher price - - especially if one offer includes stock in the acquiring company -- if they believe a rival offer provides more value for their shareholders.</p>              <p>   ""They're not bound to just take the highest price,"" said Lloyd Greif, president of Greif &amp; Co., a Los Angeles investment bank.</p>              <p>   Indeed, this year Verizon Communications Inc. won a three-month bidding war for MCI Inc., beating out Qwest Communications International Inc. even though Qwest offered $9.75 billion to Verizon's $8.5 billion.

Those foreign assets accounted for about two-thirds of Unocal's $8.2 billion in 2004 sales.</p>              <p>   Some U.S. lawmakers are concerned that a CNOOC purchase could shift more of the world's scarce supply of oil to China and away from the United States. They also fret that Chinese ownership of Unocal raises national security questions.</p>              <p>   CNOOC has framed its offer as friendly and one that is purely commercial, even though most of the financing comes from Chinese entities. For CNOOC, ""shareholder value has always been the predominant driver,"" Chief Executive Fu Chengyu said Wednesday in a conference call with reporters.</p>              <p>   Unocal's board ""has to sell its shareholders on the idea that there are more synergies and long-term value with Chevron, versus taking the money and running with CNOOC,"" said Brian Hicks, co- portfolio manager of the Global Resources Fund, a unit of U.S. Global Investors that owns about 50,000 shares of CNOOC but doesn't own Unocal or Chevron.</p>              <p>   But Greif said the CNOOC offer ""is limited at $67 a share"" for Unocal's investors, ""whereas the Chevron offer isn't because the Chevron stock component has an unlimited upside.""</p>              <p>   Picchi of Foresight Research Solutions said he doubted CNOOC was intimidated by the threat of an exhaustive U.S. review of its Unocal bid. Rather, it might welcome the scrutiny ""as a kind of clarifying exercise that will set firm policy regarding Chinese direct investment in the U.S.,"" he said.</p>              <p>   Other foreign companies, some with government ties, previously have invested in U.S. energy companies.</p>              <p>   British Petroleum, now known as BP, bought Chicago-based Amoco Corp. in 1999 and the next year completed the purchase of Los Angeles-based Arco, one of the largest gasoline retailers in Southern California.

""I think now things will calm down a bit.""</p>              <p>   Even so, Unocal employees -- who have have been reluctant to discuss their concerns because their employer has prohibited them from talking to the media -- are likely to face significant upheaval in the coming months, whether through job cuts, relocation, reassignment or the installation of new bosses.</p>              <p>   Chevron, the nation's second-largest oil company, has said it will lay off an unspecified number of Unocal's workers. Although the layoffs are likely to be spread across Unocal's global operations, the hardest hit area is expected to be the company's headquarters staff in El Segundo, where 128 corporate employees work. Chevron, based in San Ramon, Calif., has said it will not keep that facility.</p>              <p>   ""A final decision on the number of jobs that will be cut has not been made, but we have made it clear that the vast majority of Unocal employees will be needed in the combined company,"" Chevron spokesman Donald Campbell said. ""This is not an exercise in cutting people to attain savings.""</p>              <p>   Chevron, with 47,000 employees, has offered 71 Unocal employees supervisory and management-level jobs over the last few months, and 66 of them have accepted the positions, Campbell said.</p>              <p>   An additional 500 offers have gone out over the last few days. ""We're adding more people to that list as quickly as possible,"" Campbell said.</p>              <p>   Unocal spokesman Barry Lane said Tuesday that Chevron was continuing a transition and integration process it started months ago.</p>              <p>   ""Many, many people are getting offers from Chevron,"" he said. ""There's every indication that Chevron is going to absorb a good proportion of the Unocal employees.""</p>              <p>   If that's true, it marks a huge departure for Chevron and the oil industry -- and it represents the strongest sign yet that oil companies such as Chevron are already feeling the pinch of an industry-wide talent shortage that has been looming for years.</p>              <p>   It was Chevron that shed more than 4,500 jobs in the aftermath of its 2001 merger with Texaco Corp. Similarly large payroll cuts followed BP's acquisition of Amoco and Arco, as well as the deals that created ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil Corp.</p>              <p>   Given that history, it has been more than a little unusual to hear Chevron Chairman and Chief Executive David O'Reilly pledge that job cuts would be minimal after the Unocal deal.</p>              <p>   Instead of currying favor with Wall Street by promising big post- buyout savings through layoffs, O'Reilly told analysts in April that he expected yearly pretax savings of more than $325 million from the ""synergy"" of the two oil companies -- to be wrung mostly from overlapping operations in the Gulf of Mexico, Thailand and ""within corporate and support functions.""</p>              <p>   Taylor, the University of Texas professor, said the statements by O'Reilly reflected a tightening market for petroleum engineers and other workers -- a shortfall that has grown more pronounced as record-high oil prices have spurred new exploration projects.</p>              <p>   Indeed, as the fight over Unocal dragged on, rival companies stepped up efforts to steal away Unocal's employees, according to a former Unocal manager who has kept in touch with his former colleagues.</p>              <p>   Unocal's change-of-control plan has limited their success thus far, according to the former executive, who asked not to be identified because he still works in the industry. Under the plan, which is available in some form to all Unocal workers, a laid-off Unocal employee with five or more years of service can receive four months' salary, plus enhanced retirement benefits and credit for additional years of service. Those with fewer than five years of service get a less valuable payout.</p>              <p>   ""There are several head hunters going around Unocal actively pursuing people,"" the former Unocal executive said.

When Congress passed a law last month requiring a government study of the Chinese bid, CNOOC realized that the months-long delay meant that its cash offer, though higher, would not be competitive with a rival bid from Chevron Corp.</p>              <p>   The Bush administration, pressured from both the left and the right to be tougher on China, said almost nothing publicly on the issue and had appeared to just want it to go away, experts said. Yet the billions of dollars sitting in Chinese banks from exports to the United States virtually guarantee that there will soon be new bids, making it likely that U.S. policymakers will confront the same uncomfortable question.</p>              <p>   Some business executives and Asia experts say they have already seen signs that Washington is growing more resistant to Chinese acquisitions of U.S. companies. In the aftermath of the Unocal bid - - and with growing American perceptions that Chinese power is a threat -- that restrictiveness can only increase.</p>              <p>   Some cases have been visible, such as the U.S. government's 2003 rebuff, on national security grounds, of Global Crossing Ltd.'s plan to sell its communications network to Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., a Hong Kong-based group. The U.S. government permitted the Chinese company Lenovo Group to purchase IBM Corp.'s personal computer business, yet the sale took longer than many had expected, experts note.</p>              <p>   One U.S. trade advisor, who asked to remain unidentified, said the U.S. government had quietly discouraged several other planned acquisitions of U.S. telecommunications companies by Chinese and Hong Kong firms. He predicted that the CNOOC case, which increased congressional awareness about Chinese acquisitions, would increase the opposition to similar takeover efforts.</p>              <p>   ""This has got to have a major impact,"" he said.</p>              <p>   The U.S. government interagency committee that reviews such acquisitions has come under political pressure to tighten its rules. Some members of Congress have urged the committee to consider oil acquisitions a national security issue.</p>              <p>   Others, including the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a congressional advisory group, want it to greatly broaden the scope of its work by considering the domestic economic effect of acquisitions.</p>              <p>   Rep. Donald Manzullo (R-Ill.), chairman of the House Small Business Committee, declared that the process should consider ""economic security as part of national security.""</p>              <p>   Some experts believe that the interagency committee may start considering whether it is acceptable that a foreign suitor has the benefit of zero-interest loans, as the 70% government-owned CNOOC did. Some members of Congress have complained that such financing gives Chinese firms an unfair advantage over U.S. rivals.</p>              <p>   Despite pressures to impose new restrictions, there remain powerful pressures to permit such deals. U.S. business groups came out strongly in favor of allowing CNOOC to make its offer, especially since it said it was willing to sell its U.S. reserves.</p>              <p>   It is awkward for the United States to try to further limit such acquisitions when top administration officials, such as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, are regularly calling for China to play by the rules of the international system.</p>              <p>   And there are major economic advantages for the United States in having the Chinese spend part of their $700 billion in foreign currency reserves acquiring U.S. companies. Because tangible assets are harder to liquidate than U.S. Treasuries, such investments foster economic stability between the two countries.</p>              <p>   Adam Segal, an Asia specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that while the messy end of the CNOOC deal would ""poison the dialogue"" between the two countries, the pressure for acquisitions would continue.</p>              <p>   ""You still have all these growing Chinese companies that want the global management [capability], global trademarks and other things they can't produce themselves,"" he said.</p>              <p> Credit: Times Staff Writer</p>                      "

She is the former wife of George Randolph Hearst Jr., former publisher of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner.</p>              <p>   One of California's oldest and most storied oil companies officially disappeared Wednesday as Unocal Corp. shareholders approved a buyout offer from Chevron Corp.</p>              <p>   The $18-billion deal became final after owners of more than 77% of Unocal's shares voted for Chevron's offer, which seemed destined to prevail after rival bidder CNOOC Ltd. of China backed out last week amid intense congressional resistance. About 2.6% of Unocal shareholders voted against the deal with Chevron, while the remainder didn't vote.</p>              <p>   Unocal, based in El Segundo, was formally absorbed by Chevron within hours of the voting, which took place at a hotel near Los Angeles International Airport during a meeting attended by about 200 shareholders and employees.</p>              <p>   Unocal shareholders, many of whom have owned stock in the company for decades, said they were wistful about seeing the end of Unocal. But they made clear that they favored the offer from Chevron over the richer bid from across the Pacific.</p>              <p>   ""We're very patriotic and we love Unocal, "" said Lillian Auspitz, one of two Las Vegas sisters who own shares and regularly attended the company's annual meetings. ""This is a very historic and sad day for us.""</p>              <p>   Patricia Hearst, a longtime stockholder and descendant of publisher William Randolph Hearst, choked up as she took her turn at the microphone.</p>              <p>   ""I'm glad that we'll stay red, white and blue. It makes my heart warm,"" said Hearst, noting that she was close to Fred Hartley, who led Unocal for nearly three decades and died in 1990. ""But I feel very sad to see Unocal go out.""</p>              <p>   The combined company is the world's fourth-largest producer of oil and natural gas and ranks No. 3 in underground reserves of those commodities. Chevron's market value was about $140 billion as of Wednesday's market close.</p>              <p>   Unocal's primary attraction is its oil and natural gas projects in Asia and the Gulf of Mexico. Chevron Chief Executive David O'Reilly has said those assets ""fit like a glove"" with the projects his company is developing.</p>              <p>   Analysts noted that Chevron was struggling to find enough new oil to replace what it was pumping out of the ground.</p>              <p>   ""They had to do something because their production was falling a little bit short,"" said Jeb Armstrong, an analyst with Argus Research Corp.</p>              <p>   Chevron, based in San Ramon, Calif., will not keep the Unocal headquarters building or the Unocal name. However, the company already has offered jobs to 5,000 of Unocal's 6,400 worldwide employees, with more offers to come. An unspecified number of job cuts are expected, with the hardest hit likely to come among corporate employees. But Chevron has said it won't move on that front until after the end of September.</p>              <p>   Unocal Chief Executive Charles Williamson will stay on at Chevron for a few months to help with the transition, but he and his top executives will not be part of Chevron.</p>              <p>   ""There's some mixed feelings about what's happening here today,"" Williamson said. ""We have a very proud history ... but most of our employees will join Chevron. [And] Chevron's a very fine company.""</p>              <p>   It was CNOOC that started Unocal down the takeover path when it approached the company in December about selling. The interest from CNOOC, whose parent is government-controlled China National Offshore Oil Corp., attracted other bidders, including Chevron and another international oil firm that was never identified.</p>              <p>   When CNOOC failed to deliver a bid, Unocal signed a cash-and- stock deal with Chevron in early April. On June 22, CNOOC reentered the fray, making an all-cash offer of $18.5 billion for Unocal. The offer became a catalyst for heated debates in Washington about relations with China on trade, national security and monetary matters.</p>              <p>   Chevron increased its bid, but the value remained below the CNOOC offer. CNOOC, however, withdrew from the contest last week, citing ""unprecedented political opposition.""</p>              <p>   ""I think the shareholders got cheated out of $5 a share here,"" George Froley, who owns options for 60,000 Unocal shares, said at the shareholder meeting. He suggested that Unocal didn't give CNOOC much of a chance to win.</p>              <p>   Williamson disagreed. ""We seriously entertained the bid from CNOOC, and many times, we thought they would come out the winner.""</p>              <p>   Oil prices, which hit a new closing high of $64.90 a barrel in New York on Wednesday, have jumped about 14% since Chevron and Unocal first struck their deal back in April, and some analysts are predicting that they will go even higher. Asked whether he may have sold his company too soon, Williamson replied: ""It's always a dilemma to try to forecast commodity prices. I don't think we sold too early.""</p>              <p>   On the other hand, some analysts have questioned whether Chevron's purchase of Unocal would still make sense if oil prices fell.</p>              <p>   ""Our valuation of Unocal bears no resemblance to the [oil] prices that you see in the market today,"" O'Reilly said. ""Today's market prices help the valuation even further because we weren't counting on $60 oil or anything close to it.""</p>              <p>   Unocal shares gained 55 cents to $66.10 in their last day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Chevron shares rose $1.26 to $62.48, while CNOOC's New York-traded shares rose $4.17 to $76.19. Oil company shares in general moved higher in tandem with crude prices.</p>              <p>   Under the Chevron offer, Unocal shareholders could elect to receive $69 cash, 1.03 shares in Chevron stock or a mix of both for each Unocal share they own. On Wednesday, 241.9 million shares were pledged for cash, 22.1 million for stock and 10 million shares for a mix.</p>              <p>   The choices will be pro-rated to preserve the originally agreed- upon split of $27.60 a share in cash and 0.618 Chevron share, the companies said. Chevron said shareholders who elected all cash would actually get $30.13 in cash and 0.5803 Chevron share for each Unocal share. The payout, expected to be made around Aug. 17, is subject to a final accounting.</p>              <p>   Unocal, founded 115 years ago as Union Oil Co. of California in Santa Paula, was once a juggernaut in the state, owning refineries, oil fields and a network of gasoline stations bearing the 76 brand. One of the company's most tumultuous periods was in 1985, when it fended off a hostile takeover attempt from oilman T. Boone Pickens.</p>              <p>   Saddled with debt from the fight with Pickens, in 1997 Unocal sold off its refineries and gas stations, which now belong to ConocoPhillips. By the time it became a takeover target, Unocal had little left in California but its headquarters. Most of its employees and assets were overseas.</p>              <div><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""5""/><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""References""/><div class=""References_content""><p>Message No: 43509</p></div></object></div>              <div><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""41""/><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""Illustration""/><div class=""Illustration_content""><p>Caption: PHOTO: DELIVERY: A Chevron station in Redondo Beach gets gasoline.

For those and other reasons, Institutional Shareholder Services called CNOOC's bid ""highly uncertain,"" and urged Unocal stockholders to vote in favor of Chevron's offer, even though it was lower.</p>              <p>   The recommendation from ISS, which helps analyze takeover deals and other matters for large shareholders, puts further pressure on CNOOC to raise its all-cash bid of $18.5 billion, or $67 a share, if it wants to woo Unocal away from Chevron. Shareholders of El Segundo- based Unocal are scheduled to vote Aug. 10 on Chevron's cash and stock offer, which, based on Chevron's closing price Monday, is worth $17.36 billion, or $63.71.</p>              <p>   ISS calculated that a deal with CNOOC would take an additional six months to close, and the delay would reduce the value of any CNOOC bid by 5% -- not counting the risk of additional political interference, which seems likely.</p>              <p>   The energy bill passed by Congress last week requires studies that would delay a CNOOC acquisition by at least 120 days. And Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), referring to the CNOOC offer for Unocal, warned Friday that he ""will not be alone amongst my colleagues, in the Senate and in the House, who will be paying attention to what happens in the coming days, and if need be, will be prepared to act when Congress returns in September.""</p>              <p>   CNOOC, whose parent is government-controlled China National Offshore Oil Corp., has thus far declined to change its original offer even though it was rejected last month by Unocal's board. However, the Chinese oil firm is still weighing whether to raise its bid to at least $70 a share or drop out of the contest, according to an advisor to CNOOC who asked not to be identified. The person said a decision was expected very soon.</p>              <p>   While ISS could change its opinion if CNOOC opts to raise its offer, the report is nonetheless another hurdle to overcome, said Stephen Leeb, who manages $120 million in investments, including Chevron shares, at Leeb Capital Management.</p>              <p>   ""It makes it more likely that they will walk away,"" Leeb said of CNOOC. ""The people at CNOOC are not blind to the fact that Congress is not looking very fondly at this bid. If I'm betting, I'm betting that they're X-ing out Unocal and going after something else.""</p>              <p>   Chris Young, ISS director and co-head of mergers and acquisitions, said CNOOC didn't help its cause by going silent in recent weeks just when he and others wanted to hear the company's pitch.</p>              <p>   ""A lot of [Unocal shareholders] are frustrated with CNOOC's silence, or lack of assertiveness,"" Young said. ""Are you really going to turn down a deal that's certain when you don't even know what's going on with the other guy?""</p>              <p>   CNOOC spokesman Xiao Zongwei in Beijing had little comment on the ISS recommendation: ""That's a normal practice for any such kind of proxy services firm.""</p>              <p>   Xiao reiterated that CNOOC ""has never changed its position"" regarding its original offer.</p>              <p>   Shares of Unocal fell 48 cents Monday to $64.37. Although the stock price is well below a potential $70 or higher counter bid from CNOOC, its finish above Chevron's current $63.71 offer indicates there is still hope for a higher offer among some Unocal investors.</p>              <p>   Shares of San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron rose 42 cents to $58.43.</p>              <p>   As part of their campaign to sway investors, top executives of Chevron and Unocal met Monday with officials at the California Public Employees' Retirement System.</p>              <p>   Monday's opinion from ISS will carry a lot of weight with big Unocal shareholders, according to Frederick Green, head of mergers and acquisitions at law firm Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges. Glass Lewis &amp; Co., another firm that advises institutional investors and other large shareholders, said it will issue its recommendation on the Chevron proposal later this week.</p>              <p>   *</p>              <p>   Staff writers Don Lee and Marc Lifsher contributed to this report.</p>              <p> Credit: Times Staff Writer</p>                      "

All this despite growing opposition in Washington, where lawmakers have threatened to try to block any attempt by CNOOC to buy Unocal.</p>              <p>   CNOOC is 71% owned by government-controlled China National Offshore Oil Corp., and its ties to the Chinese government have sparked spirited debate over the merits of the deal and whether it presents an economic or national security threat to the United States.</p>              <p>   Indeed, Monday's filing -- an amended proxy statement issued in advance of the Aug. 10 vote by Unocal shareholders on Chevron's offer -- sheds light on previously undisclosed details of CNOOC's generous government-backed financing arrangements, which could draw even more scrutiny on Capitol Hill.</p>              <p>   The filing also provides a detailed account from Unocal's viewpoint of the brinkmanship involved in the takeover battle, which began June 22 when CNOOC unveiled its $67-a-share offer, trumping the $62 bid Chevron and Unocal had agreed to back in April.</p>              <p>   Mindful of the political risk and delay involved in a deal with CNOOC, Unocal asked both companies to improve their bids, according to the filing.</p>              <p>   On July 16, Unocal Chief Executive Charles Williamson urged CNOOC Chairman Fu Chengyu to ""make his best offer,"" telling him that ""a sufficiently large increase"" in his company's bid would probably end the battle with San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron.</p>              <p>   But Fu declined to raise CNOOC's bid without shifting some costs back to Unocal. And when Chevron sweetened its proposal July 19, the Unocal board stayed with Chevron, according to the filing.</p>              <p>   At least one large Unocal shareholder warned Monday that the battle was not over, and that CNOOC might yet make another offer. What's more, given the board's willingness to face political opposition, Chevron could still lose the board's support before the shareholder vote.</p>              <p>   ""There's more to come,"" said Jason Putman, a managing director at Victory Capital Management, holder of more than 7 million shares of Unocal stock.</p>              <p>   Chevron's revised cash-and-stock offer, which shifts in value along with the company's stock price, contains a higher cash portion than its original offer. On Monday, it was worth $17.3 billion, or $63.67 a share.</p>              <p>   Unocal's stock, meanwhile, continued to trade above the price of Chevron's offer -- an indication that investors still expect CNOOC to come back with a higher offer. On Monday, Unocal's shares closed at $64.90, down 10 cents. Chevron shares rose 58 cents to $58.37.</p>              <p>   Shareholders are going to be reluctant to side with Chevron if there is a chance of a higher offer from CNOOC, said Peter Schoenfeld, whose investment firm, P. Schoenfeld Asset Management, owns more than 1 million shares of Unocal stock.</p>              <p>   ""We're going to vote against [Chevron] as long as Chevron's stock stays where it is,"" said Schoenfeld, who wrote a letter to Unocal last week reminding executives there of their ""duty to maximize value for stockholders."" He added Monday, ""We would like to see CNOOC come back now that they've seen this better bid.""</p>              <p>   CNOOC did discuss increasing its bid from $67 a share to $69 a share, according to Unocal, but Fu said there would be two conditions. In return for the higher offer, he wanted Unocal to pay Chevron a $500-million breakup fee that CNOOC had agreed to pay as part of its original offer. And he asked Unocal to lobby Congress on CNOOC's behalf even if the Chevron agreement was still on the table.</p>              <p>   Williamson rejected the lobbying proposal and ""expressed dissatisfaction"" that Fu changed his position on the breakup fee.</p>              <p>   Xiao Zongwei, CNOOC's director of investor relations, declined Monday to say why Fu didn't boost his offer for Unocal last week. But referring to the disclosures made in Unocal's filing, Xiao said it was part of the negotiating tactics for companies ""to invite bidders to raise their bid one by one.""</p>              <p>   Ma Xiaoye, a former Chinese trade official and now head of the Academy for World Watch, an independent civic group based in Shanghai, said it was clear Fu was very interested in buying Unocal. ""But this matter is highly politicized,"" he said. ""If I were Mr. Fu, I would stop there because of so much noise and political pressure.""</p>              <p>   Indeed, that political pressure increased Monday as House-Senate negotiators working on an energy bill approved an amendment from Rep. Richard W. Pombo (R-Tracy) that would require any deal between Unocal and CNOOC to undergo an extended government review.</p>              <p>   One element of the CNOOC offer that has been sharply criticized by lawmakers and by Chevron is the financing behind the all-cash bid.</p>              <p>   Chevron has complained that the underlying financing of CNOOC's bid amounts to a subsidy from the Chinese government equal to about $10 a share of the CNOOC bid for Unocal.</p>              <p>   Steve Lipin, a spokesman for CNOOC in New York, rejected Chevron's complaints.</p>              <p>   ""CNOOC is a financially independent company from the Chinese state, and it does not receive subsidies,"" Lipin said. ""The parent giving its subsidiary attractive financing ... there's nothing nefarious, there's nothing unique about it.""</p>              <p>   Under terms of the CNOOC proposal, the company would finance the Unocal purchase with $3 billion of cash on hand and $16 billion in debt. CNOOC's government-controlled parent would provide a 30-year, $2.5-billion interest-free loan as well as a 30-year, $4.5-billion loan at an interest rate of 3.5% a year.</p>              <p>   The interest on the second loan would not be collected and ""would never be payable"" if CNOOC's credit rating dropped below a certain threshold, according to a financing summary in Unocal's Monday filing. In addition, the loans from CNOOC's parent would not include specific performance covenants or any penalties for default, Unocal said.</p>              <p>   The remaining $9 billion in financing would come from bridge loans provided by the government-owned Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and from Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and JP Morgan.</p>              <p>   Times staff writer Don Lee in Seoul contributed to this report.</p>              <p> Credit: Times Staff Writer</p>                      "

But those American firms now fear a backlash amid heightened U.S.-China trade tensions.</p>              <p>   U.S. corporations are plowing billions of dollars into shares or outright control of Chinese companies in industries as varied as beer, banking and biotech.</p>              <p>   The surge reflects Beijing's easing of restrictions on foreign ownership, as well as American executives' conviction that they simply must be in China's booming market.</p>              <p>   ""For us, it's not just a place to manufacture. It's turned into a substantial market,"" said Christopher Adams, Eastman Kodak Co.'s chief China representative in Beijing. Kodak has invested well more than $1 billion in China, and its 9,000 stores dot the nation, already Kodak's No. 1 market for roll film.</p>              <p>   Last year Anheuser-Busch Cos. paid $720 million to take over Harbin Brewery, which dominates China's beer-guzzling northeast region. Amazon.com Inc. spent $75 million for Joyo.com, China's largest online seller of books, DVDs and CDs. And private equity firm Carlyle Group agreed to put up $400 million for a 25% stake in China Pacific Life Insurance Co.</p>              <p>   But the strong U.S. political opposition to state-owned CNOOC Ltd.'s $18.5-billion offer for El Segundo-based Unocal has highlighted the tense commercial relations between the two nations. Members of Congress have railed against the CNOOC proposal as a Beijing-orchestrated grab for valuable oil resources and have threatened to block the deal on the grounds of national security. The Chinese government has warned Washington not to interfere.</p>              <p>   The standoff has raised fundamental questions about trust and fairness, how the U.S. will approach China's rising economic influence and how Beijing will respond.</p>              <p>   If CNOOC's bid is thwarted by Washington, analysts say, it will almost certainly trigger a reaction that could prove costly for American businesses.</p>              <p>   The Chinese could cut purchases of U.S. goods, as when Beijing protested an American arms deal with Taiwan by ordering aircraft from Europe's Airbus instead of Boeing Co. The Chinese also could delay approvals of American projects in China, analysts say, or add a few more hoops to the complex procedures for clearing acquisitions by foreigners.</p>              <p>   Such moves, though, could also hurt China. If Beijing pulls back from two decades of opening up its markets, it could hamper China's economic development and political reforms. Chinese companies crave not only U.S. cash but the management and technical know-how that investments and joint ventures bring.</p>              <p>   ""China has come a long way from pure state ownership to gradual private ownership and foreign ownership,"" said Rupert Li, a partner at Morrison &amp; Foerster's mergers and acquisitions law practice in Hong Kong.</p>              <p>   Liu Baocheng, dean of Sino-U.S. studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, doesn't think the outcome of a single deal such as CNOOC-Unocal will impair long-term relations between the two countries. Still, he sees the American response to CNOOC's bid as a litmus test of their current standing and what may lie ahead as China asserts itself in the international marketplace.</p>              <p>   ""This might reveal the true face of the U.S."" toward China, Liu said.</p>              <p>   Even before CNOOC lobbed its bid, strains in U.S.-China trade had been building for months. China's soaring textile exports prompted the Bush administration to impose new quotas. Several bills in Congress threaten tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing doesn't revalue its currency, which critics say is undervalued, giving Chinese exporters an unfair advantage. American industries complain about lax protection of intellectual property rights in China.</p>              <p>   Some of those issues will be discussed today by top officials from the U.S. and China meeting in Beijing for annual trade talks.</p>              <p>   For the Bush administration, the CNOOC matter is particularly difficult. On one hand, the bid is being seen against the backdrop of America's huge trade deficit with China, which is increasingly blamed on allegedly unfair Chinese trade practices. On the other hand, free trade advocates argue that it would be hypocritical for U.S. politicians to derail a deal when there isn't strong evidence that it threatens American security interests.</p>              <p>   Some of America's largest corporations, including Exxon Mobil Corp. and Bank of America Corp., have urged politicians not to interfere -- and for no small reason. Bank of America last month agreed to pay $2.5 billion for a 9% stake in one of China's largest state-run banks and has an option to buy much more. Exxon just last week signed a $3.5-billion deal with another Chinese oil company and a Saudi concern to expand a refinery in south China.</p>              <p>   And Goldman Sachs is considering an investment in China's largest bank, according to various reports.</p>              <p>   ""Almost every major company is here and making money or wanting to make money,"" said Andy Rothman, a China specialist at CLSA Asia- Pacific Markets in Shanghai. ""They don't want to spoil this.""</p>              <p>   U.S. corporations have been investing in China for years, setting up joint ventures or wholly owned enterprises, mainly to take advantage of China's cheap manufacturing base. But the pace of American investment activity has jumped in the last two years, with pledged investments exceeding $12 billion in 2004, after running in the $6-billion to $8-billion range from 1992 to 2002, according to the U.S.-China Business Council.</p>              <p>   It's unclear what share of total investments involved mergers and acquisitions, but those deals are proliferating as more Chinese businesses mature and Beijing continues to divest state-owned assets and open various industries to greater foreign ownership, under its obligations for joining the World Trade Organization in 2001.</p>              <p>   New regulations last December allowed foreigners to buy shares of Chinese insurance and media companies. China's huge retail sector also became completely open to foreign ownership, although U.S. businesses complain that Beijing has been dragging its feet in liberalizing wholesale and distribution activities.</p>              <p>   Some sectors are restricted. Foreigners can buy only as much as 20% of banks and as much as 50% of telecommunications and life insurance businesses.</p>              <p>   And one notable industry remains closed to foreigners -- energy, which is under state control. That's prompted some to ask: Why should CNOOC be allowed to buy Unocal when a bid by Unocal for CNOOC would be a nonstarter?</p>              <p>   But many others point out that it's less an issue of fairness than what the respective laws of the two nations permit. The U.S. allows such an acquisition, whereas China doesn't.</p>              <p>   ""To say, 'You can buy us, but we can't buy you' ignores the overall context in which these companies operate,"" said Steve Chu, a principal at Strategic Impact Group in Shanghai, which provides investment funds and advice. By and large, he said, foreign investment in most Chinese industries, including state-owned enterprises, is quite open. The Chinese intended it that way to develop their economy and push domestic companies to become more competitive.</p>              <p>   That's a significant difference from Japan in the 1980s, when its economic rise also triggered a backlash in the United States. Many U.S. politicians complained that Japan's markets weren't open and Japanese companies weren't receptive to takeovers by foreigners, a pattern that persists today.</p>              <p>   Many Chinese are eager to sell out or join up with a foreign partner. Just last week, American eye-care firm Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc. said it had agreed to buy a 55% stake in Shandong Chia Tai Freda Pharmaceutical Group for $200 million in cash.</p>              <p>   ""We want to get money for other investments,"" said Stephen Tse Hsin, executive director of Sino Biopharmaceutical, which owns Shandong Chia.</p>              <p>   What's in it for Bausch &amp; Lomb? A known brand in China, hundreds of sales staff members familiar with eye products, distribution channels at 1,000 hospitals and shelf space at just about every major pharmacy in the country. ""If they build their own, it might take them even 10 years"" to establish a presence like that, Hsin said.</p>              <p>   Chinese companies are now starting to venture abroad themselves. Recently, they have sought to buy established brands, illustrated by Lenovo Group Ltd.'s $1.25-billion purchase of IBM's personal computer business and appliance maker Haier Group's interest in buying Maytag Corp., reportedly for $1.3 billion.</p>              <p>   ""The trend is clear: The Chinese are going to buy more companies"" in the U.S. and other countries, said Liu of Beijing's University of International Business and Economics.</p>              <p>   Will that be met with resistance? ""If there's a perception from the Chinese that they don't have the same opportunities abroad, that could create a backlash here,"" said Jeffrey Bernstein, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. The American economy can't afford that, he said.</p>              <p>   ""U.S. companies need to take a strong position in the Chinese market.

Anything less, they said, would be tantamount to giving up.</p>              <p>   ""I see a significantly higher bid coming from CNOOC,"" said David Merjan, a portfolio manager at Chicago-based investment firm William Blair &amp; Co., which recently sold its CNOOC shares because of the Chinese company's Unocal quest. ""They will not walk away from this ... when they want something, they're very, very persistent, both from a company standpoint and from a government standpoint.""</p>              <p>   Some analysts said China's third-largest oil producer could opt to move on to other acquisition targets.</p>              <p>   If CNOOC wants to win the bidding race for Unocal, it would need to increase its bid to at least $70 a share to offset the risk to Unocal shareholders that the deal would be significantly delayed or blocked by the U.S. government, Merjan and others said. The Chinese government controls China National Offshore Oil Corp., which holds a 71% stake in publicly traded CNOOC.</p>              <p>   CNOOC last month offered to buy Unocal for $67 a share in cash, or about $18.5 billion. That price easily topped Unocal's April 4 agreement to be acquired by Chevron in a stock-and-cash deal that initially was valued at about $62 a share, or about $16.9 billion, but fell as low as $55.27 in mid-May, tracking the stock price of the San Ramon, Calif., oil giant.</p>              <p>   Although the value of Chevron's offer recovered to about $60 a share by Tuesday, Chevron felt threatened enough to improve its offer before a Unocal board meeting on Tuesday to $63.01 a share, or $17.2 billion.</p>              <p>   The revised proposal would increase the cash portion of the deal to 40% from 25%. In all, Chevron would pay about $7.5 billion in cash and would issue about 168 million new shares.</p>              <p>   Although Chevron's bid remains lower than the CNOOC offer, Unocal board members recommended that shareholders approve it at a special meeting Aug. 10. Chevron has already secured the necessary government approvals.</p>              <p>   The bid from CNOOC, on the other hand, has been dogged by extensive criticism in Washington, where legislators from both parties have denounced Unocal's possible buyout by the Chinese firm on economic and national security grounds.</p>              <p>   On Wednesday, the Senate approved a provision from Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) to require a State Department report before a foreign, government-owned company could acquire a U.S. company. The State Department would have to assess how a U.S. company in the same business would be treated if the roles were reversed.</p>              <p>   The Unocal board was justified in choosing Chevron's revised offer because ""it combines compelling value, regulatory certainty and accelerated timing"" for its shareholders, A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons analyst Bruce Lanni said in a note to clients.</p>              <p>   For now, CNOOC is sticking by its original bid. ""We regret they haven't embraced our offer yet, but we're going to monitor the situation closely,"" CNOOC spokesman Mark Palmer said. ""The $67 all- cash offer is still on the table.""</p>              <p>   Wall Street seemed unimpressed by the higher bid from Chevron, as Unocal shares fell 3 cents to $64.96 on Wednesday. Chevron shares rose 30 cents to $57.60, while CNOOC shares fell to $60, down 5 cents.</p>              <p>   ""Chevron raised their bid by about $3, and the stock essentially did nothing,"" said Merjan, whose company recently owned more than 218,000 shares of CNOOC but sold because Merjan feared a bidding war over Unocal and disagreed with the Chinese company's move to grow through acquisition. ""In no way is this the winning blow. The market is assuming an offer somewhere in the low- to mid-$70s coming from CNOOC.""</p>              <p>   Chevron shareholders, however, probably are relieved that the company didn't raise its offer by too much, said Duane Grubert, an analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners. Since Chevron and Unocal signed their April agreement, Unocal has more than halved its debt and struck a deal to sell its Canadian assets for a higher-than- expected $1.8 billion in cash to Pogo Producing Co. of Texas, he noted.</p>              <p>   ""The Canadian divestiture on its own helps Chevron rationalize increasing their bid,"" Grubert said. ""In our view, Chevron's still going to get a good deal.""</p>              <p>   Gene Gillispie, an analyst at Howard Weil Inc., said Chevron's new bid essentially restored the value of its original offer, which fell with Chevron's stock price in the last two months. He said he was unsure whether there would be many more counteroffers.</p>              <p>   Shareholders of Chevron and CNOOC ""are concerned that this thing could get out of hand,"" Gillespie said. ""If CNOOC were to raise their bid, I think that Chevron would go away. There are limits to how much you want to beat up your own shareholders.""</p>              <p>   On the other hand, Unocal's board probably already considered both CNOOC's actual bid and the reported willingness of CNOOC to up its bid to $69 a share and to set aside as much as $2.5 billion that Unocal could collect under certain circumstances if the deal died, Gillespie said.</p>              <p>   ""I have to believe that Unocal's board had a pretty good idea of what CNOOC was willing to do in terms of a revised offer ... when they made this decision"" to go with Chevron on Tuesday, he said. ""And whatever it was, it was not good enough.""</p>              <div><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""41""/><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""Illustration""/><div class=""Illustration_content""><p>Caption: GRAPHIC: Tracking the bids; CREDIT: Los Angeles Times</p></div></object></div>              <p> Credit: Times Staff Writer</p>                      "

Although CNOOC says no government money is involved in the acquisition, critics maintain that the below-market financing from China National Offshore Oil Corp. largely explains why the Chinese firm is offering more than Chevron.</p>              <p>   No one doubts a political firestorm would erupt if the American government tried to buy a U.S. oil company. In many ways, the question in Washington is whether it should be any more a cause for concern that a firm linked to the Chinese government is trying to buy a U.S. oil company.</p>              <p>   Experts disagree on the answer, but converge on one point: With China's trade surplus allowing it to stockpile foreign reserves, the issues raised in the battle over Unocal are likely to reemerge in future bids for other American companies by firms tied to the Chinese government.</p>              <p>   ""You can be pretty sure we are going to run into this situation again,"" said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, an expert on China issues at the National Security Council under President Clinton. ""If it is something that worries us, we ought to have a policy on it.""</p>              <p>   Some experts say these conflicts with China are the inevitable result of U.S. policies that have produced large American trade and budget deficits. The former has fattened China's stockpile of foreign currency; the latter has encouraged China to invest heavily in U.S. Treasury securities sold to finance the government debt.</p>              <p>   ""We have a financial relationship with the Chinese in which we are dependent on [them] financing a substantial share of our trade and budget deficits,"" said I.M. Destler, a trade expert at the University of Maryland. ""At some point they are not going to want all their assets in Treasury bills. As long as we are asking them to finance us, to the tune of hundreds of billions a year, it can't be too shocking they want to put the money in some solid assets as well as some financial assets.""</p>              <p>   Yet the prospect of a Chinese firm buying an American oil company has touched a nerve that previous Chinese acquisitions, like the purchase of IBM Corp.'s personal computer business by Lenovo Group Ltd., did not.</p>              <p>   Much of the unease in Washington springs from the claim that the Chinese firm is benefiting from the financing.</p>              <p>   CNOOC's parent owns 71% of CNOOC, with the rest owned through publicly traded stock.</p>              <p>   To help finance the Unocal deal, the parent company is providing CNOOC with $2.5 billion in interest-free loans and $4.5 billion in a 30-year loan at a below-market interest rate. In addition, CNOOC is receiving a $6-billion loan from a state-owned Chinese bank.</p>              <p>   Donald Campbell, a spokesman for Chevron, said the firm believed that preferential financing for CNOOC was worth about $2.6 billion. That's more than the difference between the Chinese firm's all-cash $18.5-billion bid and Chevron's cash and stock offer valued at $16.5 billion.</p>              <p>   CNOOC advisors say Chevron's claim is wildly inflated. A source close to CNOOC who is familiar with the deal, and who asked for anonymity while discussing its internal details, said the firm must repay the interest-free loan from its parent within two years by selling new stock. And the state-owned bank is charging market rates of interest for its loan, the advisor said.</p>              <p>   Given these constraints, the source said, the subsidized financing is worth less than a third as much as Chevron claims.</p>              <p>   Moreover, said Mark Palmer, the principal U.S. spokesman for CNOOC, the parent was providing the assistance solely because it considered the acquisition a good business deal, not to advance any government policy. CNOOC's parent has never received any operating subsidies from the Chinese government, he added.</p>              <p>   ""It is a commercial enterprise and it doesn't receive any money from the Chinese treasury,"" said Palmer, a managing director at lobbying firm Public Strategies Inc.</p>              <p>   Those arguments aren't dissuading the deal's critics. At a House Armed Services Committee hearing last week, C. Richard D'Amato, chairman of the congressionally chartered U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, charged that without ""this generous state-guided credit,"" CNOOC ""could not possibly offer $18.5 billion for an acquisition of this type.""</p>              <p>   Sens. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Max Baucus (D-Mont.), the chairman and ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, last week sent a letter to President Bush saying the CNOOC bid raised the issue of ""whether it is appropriate for state-owned enterprises to subsidize investment transactions to acquire scarce natural resources.""</p>              <p>   On Tuesday, a bipartisan group of nine senators sent Bush a letter questioning whether a CNOOC purchase of Unocal would enable the Chinese government to influence or manipulate oil prices and supplies, and ""whether the proposal is expected to be followed by proposals by other Chinese government owned or controlled entities to acquire other energy assets belonging to United States corporations.""</p>              <p>   Other skeptical senators and House members have proposed a mandatory 180-day government economic review of the transaction, which would probably derail CNOOC's bid.</p>              <p>   Many free trade advocates see the concerns about Chinese ownership as misguided.</p>              <p>   They note that the national oil company of Venezuela, a country whose relations with the U.S. are also often strained, has owned Citgo Petroleum Corp. for more than a decade without threatening American energy security.</p>              <p>   ""I'm not sure what the scenario would be in which the Chinese government would use its ownership of Unocal to damage the U.S. economy,"" said Jerry Taylor, director of natural resource studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""We are both net importers of oil ... and for that reason, the Chinese have every incentive to produce.""</p>              <p>   Others maintain that the controversy should encourage the U.S. to think more systematically about the economic and security dimensions of competing with China's hybrid economy.</p>              <p>   ""That is the kind of system that the U.S. government and U.S. trade law ... have a very difficult time getting their arms around,"" Tonelson of the U.S. business group said.</p>              <div><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""5""/><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""References""/><div class=""References_content""><p>Message No: 39264</p></div></object></div>              <p> Credit: Times Staff Writer</p>                      "

Unocal's board is weighing the bid against a $16.8-billion offer from Chevron Corp.</p>              <p>   Lockyer, echoing worries of officials in New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Montana and Texas, will send a letter to Unocal executives as early as today expressing concerns about the enforceability of various cleanup pacts and other agreements if the El Segundo oil company is bought by CNOOC, said Tom Dresslar, Lockyer's spokesman.</p>              <p>   ""An acquisition by a foreign-owned entity injects uncertainty in terms of meeting environmental cleanup obligations and protecting retired workers' pensions and healthcare benefits,"" Dresslar said. Each of those states has worries about how a sale of Unocal to CNOOC would affect their ability to force a foreign company to pay up for ground and water cleanup, he said.</p>              <p>   In New Mexico, for example, a Unocal subsidiary operates an open- pit mine, said Sam Thompson, spokeswoman for that state's attorney general, Patricia A. Madrid. ""Were the owner of the corporation to be outside the United States, it might make it more difficult for states to be compensated for damage to natural resources.""</p>              <p>   Texas Atty.

Unocal spokesman Mike Thatcher declined to comment Tuesday because the company had not received the letter.</p>              <p>   Operations based in the United States are generally subject to U.S. laws no matter who the owner is, said James White, president of White Environmental Associates in Brea.</p>              <p>   But in Unocal's case, there are cleanup obligations from past operations and Lockyer wonders what would happen to Unocal's environmental liabilities if CNOOC sells U.S. operations and only those liabilities remain, Dresslar said.</p>              <p>   ""That's a real good question,"" said White, an environmental consultant to the oil industry. ""The attorney general may have some valid concerns regarding assets that are no longer operational in the United States.""</p>              <p>   However, it wasn't clear what influence the attorneys general could have on any transaction.</p>              <p>   CNOOC , 71% owned by state-controlled China National Offshore Oil Corp., offered in late June to buy Unocal for $18.5 billion in cash, or $67 a share.</p>              <p>   The unsolicited offer came more than two months after Unocal agreed to be bought by San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron Corp. in a stock-and-cash deal valued at about $61.49 a share, or $16.8 billion, as of Tuesday. Unocal shareholders vote on the Chevron proposal Aug. 10.</p>              <p>   ""We're not taking a position on who should win the vote of Unocal shareholders,"" Dresslar said Tuesday. ""We're representing the concern of the people of the state of California.

His task is a delicate one: Sink the Chinese oil company's buyout offer without damaging relations with CNOOC, a partner and customer on some Chevron projects.</p>              <p>   ""It's hard, but at the end of the day, hopefully, we're all practical people,"" Robertson said in an interview last week. ""The biggest U.S. companies, the biggest international companies -- we compete with them every day, and yet we're partners with them in many projects around the world. That's the way we would like to view this too.""</p>              <p>   Robertson has been featured in public forums bluntly criticizing CNOOC's attempt to break up Unocal's pending sale to Chevron in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $16.9 billion when it was proposed in April. That agreement, worth $16.4 billion on Friday, will be put to a shareholder vote Aug. 10.</p>              <p>   The showdown began in late June when CNOOC, a majority of whose stock is held by government-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp., moved to lure away Unocal with an unsolicited $18.5-billion all- cash offer. CNOOC covets the El Segundo company's hefty oil and national gas reserves in Asia but would also get the company's holdings in the U.S., including in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>              <p>   In response, Chevron put forth Robertson as its antagonist in chief and unleashed its formidable lobbying forces in Washington to spread the notion that CNOOC's government ties made the Unocal deal a matter of national and economic security.</p>              <p>   A Scot by birth and a refinery engineer by training, Robertson is a company man whose 30 years in Chevron management culminated in December in his appointment to the newly created office of the chairman.</p>              <p>   In that role, he works closely with David O'Reilly, Chevron's chairman and chief executive. The two, born only days apart in January 1947, have adjacent offices and meet often to discuss and coordinate their activities, Robertson said.</p>              <p>   Observers think Robertson was tapped as chief CNOOC opponent for another reason: to help distance O'Reilly from what was bound to become a heated battle between the bidders.</p>              <p>   ""He is the hatchet man. He's playing a useful role as far as putting the company's view forward,"" said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ""You want to get someone else so that the CEO can later say, 'That was not me, that was my deputy.' ""</p>              <p>   Despite the showdown over Unocal, Chevron hopes to avoid discord between the two companies in China, where they are partners in offshore oil development projects in Bohai Bay and the South China Sea. Chevron, a presence in China since 1913, also has gasoline stations and an interest in several methane gas projects in the country.</p>              <p>   In Australia, Chevron is one of six companies partnered with CNOOC in a huge operation known as the North West Shelf Venture, which will supply China with liquefied natural gas.</p>              <p>   More crucial, however, is Chevron's 50% stake in the Gorgon liquefied natural gas project off the coast of Australia. In late 2003, CNOOC signed a tentative agreement worth more than $22 billion to take an ownership interest in the project and sizable gas deliveries for 25 years.</p>              <p>   Some reports have suggested that negotiations related to that contract have slowed or stalled amid the rancor over Unocal. Both Chevron and CNOOC have disputed that.</p>              <p>   In Washington, the CNOOC offer has sparked anti-Chinese rhetoric beyond the proposal to include disputes over trade, currency and foreign policy.</p>              <p>   There have been a flurry of letters to President Bush expressing concern over CNOOC's bid, as well as strident speeches on the House floor, a bipartisan resolution condemning the deal and a hearing before the House Armed Services Committee.</p>              <p>   CNOOC has fought back with its own team of lobbyists and a series of ads in publications that cater to Congress urging them to ""learn the facts about CNOOC's bid to buy Unocal."" Those facts, CNOOC said, are that the deal would pose no threat to U.S. national security, that Unocal's domestic production would stay in the U.S. and that CNOOC would protect Unocal jobs.</p>              <p>   Through it all, Robertson's criticism has been pointed. In interviews, he has labeled CNOOC's bid as politically sensitive and risky for shareholders, and has complained that the Beijing company's offer is being unfairly subsidized through low-interest loans from the Chinese government.</p>              <p>   The day after CNOOC's Unocal bid was announced, Robertson went further.</p>              <p>   ""Americans are worried about the supply of oil and gas. There is an issue here of who can put more oil and gas into the market on a commercial basis,"" Robertson told CNBC. ""I think if the Chinese government buys this asset, you can be sure that much of these materials will go to China.""</p>              <p>   Last week, Robertson struck a more conciliatory tone.</p>              <p>   ""CNOOC is a very Westernized company, and a good company. I just think that they're getting a little bit of an unfair advantage here,"" he said. As for Fu Chengyu, CNOOC's U.S.-educated chairman and chief executive, Robertson said, ""He's been to my home. I enjoy him a lot.""</p>              <p>   Robertson expressed discomfort with the escalating anti-China rhetoric in Congress, saying that he wanted Chevron's objections heard, ""but we don't want to participate in all this heat and bad feeling....

Indeed, some of the most vocal congressional critics hail from California, and their speeches and letters to the Bush administration closely track Chevron's talking points.</p>              <p>   In addition, he said, Robertson has ""said some unfortunate things about CNOOC.""</p>              <p>   Industry experts are divided about the long-term effects of the Unocal fight on Chevron's relations with CNOOC and its prospects for future business in China.</p>              <p>   ""Their commentary is that 'we're just talking about business.' ... They think it falls in the category of having a friendly lawsuit going on,"" Matthew Simmons, chairman of Houston investment bank Simmons &amp; Co., said of Chevron's approach. ""They're creating a lot of scar tissue.""</p>              <p>   Mikkal Herberg, director of the Asian Energy Security program at the National Bureau of Asian Research in Seattle, said the Chinese would be unhappy about Chevron's actions.</p>              <p>   Still, ""my guess would be that China is pragmatic enough to see that all's fair in business and war, and they will not take it out on Chevron later,"" Herberg said.

"303","2005-06-25","Chinese Bid for Unocal Stirs Up Issues; American policymakers are facing questions about communism, global commerce and the dependence of the U.S. on foreign oil.","422028211","Los Angeles Times","C.1","            >                                        >                          <p>   This week's bid by a leading Chinese oil company for Unocal Corp. is forcing U.S. policymakers to confront two sensitive issues: America's dependence on imported oil and its future relations with China, a rising economic and military power.</p>              <p>   CNOOC Ltd.'s unsolicited $18.5-billion bid for El Segundo-based Unocal has sparked a vigorous debate among policymakers and analysts about American access to energy supplies in an increasingly interdependent global economy.</p>              <p>   On Friday, 41 members of Congress from both parties sent a letter to Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, who heads the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, urging him to immediately initiate a thorough review of a possible deal.</p>              <p>   Among their concerns was whether CNOOC was using Chinese government funds to make the purchase and whether China would be acquiring sensitive technology.</p>              <p>   Some observers, including a senior Energy Department official, contend that it doesn't really matter who controls the wells as long as oil is traded globally. But others say it is dangerous for more oil supplies to fall into the hands of potentially hostile governments amid growing competition for scarce resources and instability in oil-rich regions such as the Middle East and Latin America.</p>              <p>   The bid also is sparking debate about whether China, one of the few remaining communist governments, should be treated as an ally or a rival. That's a sensitive question, in part because American firms want access to China's huge market and the United States needs Beijing's support for resolving thorny disputes in places such as North Korea. And some contend that China has already made great strides toward developing a market economy, and that a friendly approach would encourage it to do even more.</p>              <p>   But others say Beijing doesn't play fair in trade, steals American technology and thus can't be trusted.</p>              <p>   Although Chinese firms have made other pushes into the U.S. market, including a recent bid by Haier Group for Maytag Corp., the CNOOC deal would dwarf all other purchases and raise the stakes dramatically.</p>              <p>   Opinions are divided on whether a CNOOC deal -- if accepted by Unocal over a rival $17-billion bid by Chevron Corp. -- would get the green light from the U.S. government given the highly charged atmosphere in Congress over China. There are more than a dozen bills pending that would penalize the Asian nation for alleged trade abuses. Concerns about China's expanding military expenditures are also on the rise.</p>              <p>   ""The red flag associated with [China] is just growing and growing and growing, and it's not just [in] the Congress,"" said David Bachman, a China scholar at the University of Washington.</p>              <p>   The controversy places the Bush administration, which has close ties to the global oil industry and has pushed for open energy markets around the world, in an awkward position. Any action against Chinese companies in the United States could trigger retaliation against U.S. firms.</p>              <p>   Although U.S. officials have steered clear of commenting on the deal, the administration has said it supports global competition in energy and welcomes new investment that could expand fuel supplies. The administration has generally resisted calls for tougher sanctions on China -- except in the case of textiles -- arguing that diplomacy is a better way to open China's markets and encourage financial reforms.</p>              <p>   In an interview before this week's CNOOC announcement, Karen Harbert, a senior U.S. Energy Department official, said China's rising energy consumption and its quest for energy resources abroad did not pose a ""threat to U.S. interests or a threat to U.S. companies"" because oil was a ""fungible global commodity"" whose price cannot be set by one country.</p>              <p>   Harbert said the Bush administration was concerned that investments by China or other countries into energy resources be made in a ""fair and transparent"" manner.</p>              <p>   ""We don't dictate to China where it can invest, and they don't dictate to us where we can invest,"" said Harbert, the assistant secretary of energy for policy and international affairs.</p>              <p>   Harbert said any Chinese bid would need to go ""through the standard vetting process here. There are no pre-decisions, no policy determination that we would vote one way or another.""</p>              <p>   The job of sorting through these thorny issues is likely to go to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an interagency group that vets foreign purchases of sensitive U.S. assets.</p>              <p>   CNOOC has said it is ready to open its books for the committee and is prepared to address concerns about its possible ownership of Unocal assets.</p>              <p>   Free-market supporters contend that it would be discriminatory for the U.S. to deny CNOOC access to the U.S. energy market when foreign firms, including BP and Royal Dutch/Shell, have been major players for decades.</p>              <p>   But Gal Luft, executive director of the Washington-based Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, said the U.S. was endangering the future competitiveness of U.S. energy companies if it allowed them to be outbid by a Chinese state-owned firm with government financial backing.</p>              <p>   Such a deal would give Chinese firms access to sophisticated deep- water drilling technology, he said.</p>              <p>   ""U.S. firms have some technological edge in off-shore operations, but they're losing it very quickly,"" he said. ""This is only the first case in what could be a systematic effort by the Chinese to outbid American companies.""</p>              <p>   The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States was established in the 1970s after the Arab oil embargo amid concern about the rise of Middle Eastern oil powers.</p>              <p>   One of its first cases involved the $2.5-billion acquisition of Santa Fe Petroleum by the state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Co., according to a Cato Institute study. That deal was approved after the Kuwaiti firm agreed to keep sensitive technology out of its government's control.</p>              <p>   The committee has largely taken a free-market approach. In its reviews of more than 1,000 cases, it has raised concerns about only a handful of deals. In most instances, foreign buyers backed off or agreed to amend their bids, said Daniel Griswold, Cato's director of trade policy.</p>              <p>   In 1988, congressional critics, worried that the U.S. was selling off family jewels, sought to beef up the process by giving the president authority to block foreign deals if they threatened national security.</p>              <p>   That trigger has been pulled once, and the target was China, according to trade experts. In 1990, amid concerns over Chinese acquisitions of sensitive U.S. technology, then-President George H.W. Bush ordered China National Aero-Technology Import &amp; Export Corp. to sell its interest in Mamco Manufacturing Co., an aerospace firm that supplied Boeing Co.</p>              <div><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""41""/><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""Illustration""/><div class=""Illustration_content""><p>Caption: PHOTO: SECRETARY: John Snow received a letter asking him to review CNOOC's bid for Unocal.; PHOTOGRAPHER: Larry Downing Reuters</p></div></object></div>              <p> Credit: Times Staff Writer</p>                      "

Gen. Bill Lockyer, along with the top law enforcement officers of Montana, New Mexico and Texas, sent a letter to Unocal President Joseph H. Bryant seeking assurances that Unocal would continue to pay for cleanup at Unocal waste sites in their states. Tom Dresslar, Lockyer's spokesman said the letter was sent by fax late Wednesday to Bryant's office in Sugarland, Texas.</p>              <p>   CNOOC, which is 71% owned by the Chinese government, has offered to buy El Segundo-based Unocal for $18.5 billion in cash. Unocal officials are weighing the bid against an acquisition proposal from San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron Corp., which in early April offered to buy the company in a stock and cash deal that was worth $16.5 billion as of Wednesday.</p>              <p>   ""Should CNOOC's offer be accepted, we are deeply concerned that the funding for cleanup of the sites in our respective states may be jeopardized,"" the officials said in the Unocal letter. ""We urgently need assurances that a CNOOC-owned Unocal could and would honor all of Unocal's current and future environmental obligations.""</p>              <p>   Unocal spokesman Mike Thacher said he couldn't confirm that Bryant had received the letter, but added: ""We will review it and respond appropriately.""</p>              <p>   Mark Palmer, a spokesman for CNOOC, said the company would ""comply with all the laws and regulations of the United States and of states where Unocal has operations, including the relevant laws and regulations governing environmental remediation and worker protections.""</p>              <p>   The attorneys general also asked for reassurance that the pension and healthcare benefits due to former Unocal employees would be maintained under a CNOOC deal.

Its chief executive studied at USC and is said to prefer Diet Coke to tea. Its Beijing offices sport a big electronic board displaying stock prices. And its executives are fond of talking about serving shareholders.</p>              <p>   ""We are trying to create value for our shareholders,"" its director of investor relations said.</p>              <p>   Talk like that may sound odd coming from a company whose stock is 71% owned by the Chinese government and whose CEO, however direct his management style, ultimately answers to Beijing.</p>              <p>   But over the last two decades, CNOOC Ltd. has built a reputation in Asia as a well-run company with a distinctly Western and outward orientation, a cut above most other Chinese state-owned enterprises.</p>              <p>   Now, it'll need to draw on all of its experience to accomplish its most ambitious overseas move yet. Thursday, the oil company made an unsolicited, $18.5-billion cash offer to acquire El Segundo- based Unocal Corp., topping a pending $17-billion bid by Chevron Corp.</p>              <p>   The offer is the largest ever by a Chinese company for a foreign firm, and it sets up the first bidding war between American and Chinese companies. American politicians immediately questioned the offer, raising the specter of China as an emerging economic and political rival of the United States and the security implications of its taking over a major U.S. energy concern.</p>              <p>   But CNOOC took great pains to follow the protocol and style of a savvy American company. It lined up two of Wall Street's top investment banks, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, to advise it on the deal. It launched an English-language website specifically to explain its offer to Americans. And its CEO, fluent in English from his days in Los Angeles earning a master's degree in petroleum engineering from USC, immediately set out to win the publicity battle.</p>              <p>   Fu Chengyu, CNOOC's 54-year-old chief, suggested that Americans' concerns stemmed largely from a misunderstanding of his firm. ""I think once they understand the company, they will be more accepting of CNOOC,"" he said Thursday.</p>              <p>   To the Chinese, it's not surprising that CNOOC is attempting the ambitious offer. Though a distant third in size among China's ""big three"" state-controlled oil firms, CNOOC was created to pursue foreign deals.</p>              <p>   From its inception in 1982 under Beijing's early economic reform policies, CNOOC was charged with exploring and developing offshore oil and natural gas fields by forming partnerships with outsiders. The company's development in many ways parallels China's evolution from a planned economy to one based largely on the market.</p>              <p>   It was one of the first Chinese companies to go into business with foreign firms. It also was one of the first to sell stock to the public. You can buy its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>              <p>   It has taken other steps to be more like Western companies. Unlike other chiefs of Chinese state-owned enterprises, Fu doesn't have an entourage when he travels. English is spoken so commonly in CNOOC offices that people say, ""Excuse me,"" when getting off elevators.</p>              <p>   In recent years, CNOOC has stepped up its global acquisitions, buying stakes in South Asia, in Australia and most recently in Canada's dry oil sands. CNOOC, with revenue of $6.7 billion last year, is the largest offshore oil producer in Indonesia.</p>              <p>   Its attempt to outbid Chevron, a company five times its size in total stock market value, represents the latest in a string of bold moves by major Chinese companies to fulfill global expansionary dreams. It follows Lenovo Group's purchase of IBM Corp.'s PC business and appliance maker Haier Group's bid to buy Maytag Corp.</p>              <p>   CNOOC's effort, though, differs from the others, not only in size but also in its close link to Chinese national interests. It has become the model for Beijing's explicit policy, laid out a year ago, to pursue and secure energy resources abroad to feed its booming economy and reduce its growing reliance on imported oil, whose prices have skyrocketed in part because of China's surging demand. A successful Unocal purchase would add depth to CNOOC's Asian reserves and projects.</p>              <p>   CNOOC also may have the best chance of any Chinese oil company to pass muster with U.S. government officials. Unlike PetroChina and Sinopec, the top two Chinese oil players, CNOOC has had no involvement in cutting energy deals in countries such as Venezuela, Sudan and Iran that have been at odds with American foreign policy.</p>              <p>   As such, CNOOC is the ""most suitable candidate to pass all the scrutiny of the U.S.,"" said Ma Xiaoye, director of the Shanghai- based think tank Academy for World Watch.</p>              <p>   CNOOC's executives insist that politics aren't driving their bid for Unocal; it's strictly commercial. They point out that unlike most other state-owned companies, CNOOC has eight directors, four of them outsiders, who took pains to hire independent experts to evaluate the soundness of the deal.</p>              <p>   CNOOC's culture is open and transparent, analysts and bankers say, and the company hasn't been stained by scandals that have damaged the reputation and stocks of other state-owned companies.</p>              <p>   Company executives also downplay their connection with Beijing.</p>              <p>   ""We're a government company, but we don't get a penny from the government,"" said Yang Hua, CNOOC's chief financial officer.</p>              <p>   Still, as much as CNOOC talks and walks like a typical publicly traded company, there's no denying that it is accountable to Beijing -- a factor that will be weighed by U.S. shareholders and government officials alike.</p>              <p>   ""I can't think of a company that's closer to the government. The blood tie, it's right there,"" said Wenran Jiang, a University of Alberta political scientist who has studied China's hunt for energy in Canada and throughout the world. The Unocal bid ""is absolutely government-sanctioned,"" he added. ""And it will be a concern.""</p>              <p>   Some analysts would contend that state-owned companies get all of their financing from the government, still the biggest shareholder even in those that have sold stock to the public.</p>              <p>   A Chinese state-owned enterprise ""is not based on a profit- making premise,"" said Matthew Cairns, an Asia specialist at research firm Economy.com in Sydney, Australia.</p>              <p>   CNOOC acknowledges that its Unocal bid required approval from the highest levels of government. And to finance its offer, CNOOC's state-owned parent company, Beijing-based China National Offshore Oil Corp., committed to providing $7 billion in loans, with an additional $6 billion coming from a state-owned bank. The parent has many other operations, including a fertilizer business.</p>              <p>   CNOOC executives wouldn't talk specifically about the government's hand in the company's strategy or in the offer for Unocal. Instead, they spoke about the lengthy and deliberative process on the board, suggesting that this showed the independence of directors and attention paid to commercial interests and shareholder value -- characteristics of responsible American companies.</p>              <p>   Fu was a driving force behind the offer, people familiar with the company say. Liang Weipei, an industry analyst at Hong Kong brokerage Tai Fook Securities, said Fu and his management team showed sophistication in pursuing the offer. The offer price was skillfully set below what many analysts were expecting but high enough to leave some room for a bump up, Liang said. It also showed restraint, he said, and thus was viewed favorably by CNOOC investors.</p>              <p>   CNOOC's U.S.-traded shares rose $1.84 to $55.15 on Thursday in an otherwise down market.</p>              <p>   Liang said he didn't think Beijing was orchestrating the offer: ""Given China's energy shortage in recent years, it's understandable why outsiders would presume that the government was behind the proposal. So far, I don't see signs to prove that. I guess only if the acquisition is completed will we find out.""</p>              <p>   *</p>              <p>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</p>              <p>   A look at the companies</p>              <p>   Although CNOOC's revenue has been lower than Unocal's, its profit has been higher.

Duncan Hunter (R-El Cajon) said after a hearing at which his committee's Republicans and some of its Democrats -- and three of the four invited witnesses -- said Chinese ownership of El Segundo- based Unocal would compromise U.S. national security. Hunter raised the possibility that China could use its ownership of Unocal's energy resources as a lever in the event of a showdown with the United States over a hypothetical effort to take over Taiwan.</p>              <p>   Meanwhile CNOOC Ltd., a majority of whose stock is held by government-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp., was said to be considering ways to reassure Unocal that its bid would hold up under mounting political opposition. CNOOC offered last month to buy Unocal for $18.5 billion in cash, trumping a $16.9-billion bid by Chevron Corp., a much larger oil industry rival.</p>              <p>   The CNOOC board, which met Wednesday, is expected to set aside more than $2 billion in a U.S. escrow account that would become Unocal property if the CNOOC bid fails, according to the Financial Times, which cited unnamed sources. The Chinese company also could raise its bid price, the newspaper said.</p>              <p>   Unocal's board meets today to discuss whether to continue recommending approval of the Chevron deal when its shareholders gather to vote on that proposal Aug. 10. Analysts say Chevron is banking on winning shareholder approval based on the fear that CNOOC's offer, although worth more money, is too risky given the political heat.</p>              <p>   If Unocal's shareholders choose the CNOOC offer, a panel chaired by Treasury Secretary John W. Snow will have to decide whether to review the deal.</p>              <p>   At the House Armed Services Committee's hearing, C. Richard D'Amato, chairman of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, said the foreign investment committee had a record of lax oversight of foreign purchases of U.S. assets.</p>              <p>   Of the 1,530 transactions reviewed by the foreign investment committee since 1988, D'Amato said, only one was rejected. An unknown number were withdrawn when it appeared that the committee would block them, he said.</p>              <p>   ""A more aggressive oversight system surely will be needed if the Chinese accelerate their buying spree into the American economy,"" D'Amato said. He said that even if the foreign investment committee approved the sale, Congress could act under its constitutional power to ""regulate commerce with foreign nations.""</p>              <p>   D'Amato and two other witnesses -- former CIA Director R. James Woolsey and Frank J. Gaffney Jr., president of the Center for Security Policy -- concentrated on two arguments to oppose the CNOOC purchase of Unocal: the strategic value of oil and the refusal of China to abide by international economic rules. CNOOC wasn't invited to testify.</p>              <p>   ""I believe the object of China's actions is inexorably to supplant the United States as the world's premier economic power and, if necessary, to defeat us militarily,"" said Gaffney, a Defense Department official in the Reagan administration.</p>              <p>   Among the witnesses, only Jerry Taylor, director of natural resource studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank in Washington, found any virtue in the proposed CNOOC-Unocal deal. Unocal accounted for only 0.23% of the world's oil production, he said -- ""not exactly Saudi Arabia-size.""</p>              <p>   ""There is no reason to worry about the impact that a merger between CNOOC and Unocal might have on domestic energy prices or America's access to oil,"" he said. ""Unocal would not provide China with an 'oil weapon.' ""</p>              <p>   Mark Palmer, a public relations advisor to CNOOC, said Wednesday that the Chinese offer was far more generous to Unocal's shareholders than Chevron's and that U.S. security concerns would be respected. These are among several points that CNOOC will emphasize in a series of print advertisements, starting this week, in Washington publications.</p>              <p>   Still, CNOOC faces a barrage of anti-Chinese sentiment in Congress.</p>              <p>   The chairman and the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee wrote Wednesday to President Bush to express concern that the purchase would violate World Trade Organization rules against government subsidies in transactions involving international trade.</p>              <p>   Citing the deal's financing from CNOOC's parent, Sens. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Max Baucus (D-Mont.) asked ""whether it is appropriate for state-owned enterprises to subsidize investment transactions to acquire scarce natural resources that are in high demand.""</p>              <p>   Last month, the House of Representatives passed two measures aimed at blocking the proposed CNOOC purchase: a resolution raising national security issues and an appropriations amendment forbidding the Treasury Department from spending federal funds to approve such an acquisition by CNOOC.</p>              <p>   Wall Street traders are signaling that they expect Chevron's offer to be topped. On Wednesday, Unocal shares rose 84 cents to $66.75.</p>              <p>   In April, Unocal agreed to be acquired by Chevron in a cash-and- stock deal with a value that fluctuates with the price of the San Ramon, Calif., oil company's stock. Chevron shares fell 4 cents Wednesday to $57.47, making the bid worth about $60.65 a share. CNOOC is offering $67 a share.</p>              <p>   If Unocal's board chooses to endorse the CNOOC bid, the company would have to immediately pay Chevron $250 million, plus another $250 million if Unocal is purchased by CNOOC within a year.</p>              <p>   ""As it stands right now, I would probably not vote for the deal on Aug. 10,"" said Jason Putman, managing director of Victory Capital Management, a big Unocal shareholder. ""Chevron's going to have to raise its bid.""</p>              <p>   Chevron continued to stand pat on its bid and pushed ahead with plans to promote Unocal employees as part of preparing for the integration of the two oil companies.</p>              <p>   The company selected candidates to fill 46 more management and supervisory posts at various levels of its exploration and production units, Chevron spokesman Don Campbell said. More than 20 others agreed this month to take jobs with the combined company.</p>              <p>   The latest selections include positions ""that enhance our ability to integrate Chevron and Unocal as swiftly and effectively as possible,"" Chevron Chief Executive David O'Reilly said in an Wednesday e-mail to employees of both companies. He said the company hoped to complete the job-selection process by the end of September.</p>              <div><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""41""/><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""Illustration""/><div class=""Illustration_content""><p>Caption: PHOTO: RAISING CONCERNS: From left, C.

Chinese companies have acquired IBM's personal computer business and made bids for Maytag and, most spectacularly, Unocal, the El Segundo- based oil company. Unocal's board of directors, which had earlier agreed to sell the company to Chevron, is now reviewing an $18.5- billion offer from CNOOC Ltd., China's third-largest oil company.</p>              <p>   Washington will closely review the offer as well, at a time when China-bashing on Capitol Hill is reaching alarming proportions. On Thursday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned members of Congress that their China-focused protectionist instincts pose a threat to the U.S. economy.</p>              <p>   The United States has legitimate grievances in its dealings with Beijing -- piracy of intellectual property chief among them -- but overheated talk of slapping high tariffs on Chinese goods if that country doesn't alter how it manages its currency amounts to self- defeating hysteria.</p>              <p>   Lost in all the rhetoric is the fact that most of America's bilateral trade deficit with China is not attributable to some communist plot, but to U.S. manufacturers that own factories in China and ship their products home.</p>              <p>   As a lender and as a supplier of low-cost goods, China has proved a reliable business partner.</p>              <p>   Not long ago, China was a net exporter of oil, but its growing need for imported oil is one reason crude is trading at $60 a barrel. As the nation emerges from poverty into the global middle class, it is natural that China's consumption of global resources starts mirroring its one-fifth share of global population.</p>              <p>   For well over half a century, ensuring sufficient reserves and a steady flow of oil has been a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy. China now has to think in similar ways. Rather than leading to a zero-sum showdown, this affinity of interests between the two nations, if handled properly, could strengthen the relationship.</p>              <p>   For decades, U.S. investment has poured into oil exploration and distribution around the world, and it would be rather cheeky and colonialist of Washington to decree that Chinese capital is not welcome to the game. CNOOC is especially interested in Unocal because of the company's reserves in Asia. The fact that CNOOC is backed by the Chinese government is hardly novel in the global oil industry -- the state oil enterprises of Venezuela and Saudi Arabia have long backed overseas ventures that do business in this country.</p>              <p>   If Unocal's board decides the offer is desirable to its shareholders and the deal proceeds, the interagency Committee for Foreign Investment in the U.S. will review whether it compromises national security by transferring militarily sensitive technology to the Chinese. But overwrought claims that Beijing is out to gain control of ""our"" oil must be dismissed as more groundless China- bashing.</p>                      "
"308","2005-06-23","THE WORLD; Chinese Oil Firm Bids for Unocal; The $18.5-billion offer, which tops Chevron's, raises concerns about the potential for foreign ownership of a U.S. energy company.","422043875","Los Angeles Times","A.1","            >                                        >                          <p>   A major Chinese oil company made a landmark offer to buy California-based Unocal Corp. for $18.5 billion on Wednesday, topping a bid by rival U.S. oil giant Chevron Corp. and setting the stage for an intense political debate over the future of U.S. energy, security and trade policies.</p>              <p>   The unsolicited offer by CNOOC Ltd., an arm of state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp., was the most dramatic example yet of China's growing influence in global markets and would be China's largest foreign acquisition by far.</p>              <p>   The proposed buyout could raise hackles in the United States, which is heavily dependent on foreign oil. China's fast-growing economy is consuming ever-larger amounts of crude, which is helping to drive the price to record heights on world markets, and CNOOC wants to add Unocal's assets to its energy reserves.</p>              <p>   Fu Chengyu, CNOOC's chairman and chief executive, said his company's $67-a-share cash bid ""is a good offer for Unocal"" and ""it is good for America.""</p>              <p>   In a telephone interview from Beijing, Fu noted that CNOOC's proposal to Unocal included several pledges to assuage U.S. concerns, such as keeping most of Unocal's 6,600 workers and selling its U.S.-produced oil and gas within the United States.</p>              <p>   If people ""have a better understanding"" of CNOOC, ""I think there will be less concern both politically and maybe economically,"" said Fu, who earned a master's degree in petroleum engineering from USC and once worked for Phillips Petroleum Co., now part of ConocoPhillips.</p>              <p>   Still, CNOOC's proposal is likely to incite a ""firestorm"" in Congress, said Mikkal Herberg, director of the Asian Energy Security program at the National Bureau of Asian Research, a Seattle think tank.</p>              <p>   Herberg predicted that the CNOOC bid would ""feed the fear that the Chinese are coming, the Chinese are coming,"" and could further inflame tensions between the two countries over textile trade and currency issues.</p>              <p>   One congressman, Rep. Richard W. Pombo (R-Tracy), said he didn't believe it was ""in the best interest of the United States to have Unocal owned by the Chinese national government,"" adding that the deal could have ""disastrous consequences for our economic and national security.""</p>              <p>   Pombo and Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-El Cajon) sent a letter to President Bush last week urging him to look closely at any Chinese bid to acquire U.S. energy assets. Such an attempt ""raises many concerns about U.S. jobs, energy production and energy security,"" their letter said.</p>              <p>   C. Richard D'Amato, chairman of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a congressional advisory panel that has been sharply critical of U.S. policy toward China, said his group would also ask President Bush to closely review the CNOOC offer.</p>              <p>   ""When we're so dependent on foreign suppliers, giving away American sources of petroleum and hydrocarbons doesn't make sense to me,"" said D'Amato, an attorney and former member of the Maryland state legislature.</p>              <p>   White House spokesman Trent Duffy declined to comment Wednesday on CNOOC's offer.</p>              <p>   Under U.S. law, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States -- an interagency committee headed by Treasury Secretary John W. Snow -- is responsible for reviewing any foreign purchases that could threaten U.S. security.</p>              <p>   Herberg, of the National Bureau of Asian Research, said some specific security issues related to a CNOOC-Unocal deal could trigger U.S. concern. Unocal has some ""very, very good deep-water exploration skills"" developed in projects off Indonesia and Mexico that could have military applications, he said.</p>              <p>   Critics are likely to ""question letting that technology fall into the hands of the Chinese government,"" said Herberg, who recently testified on China's energy strategy before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>              <p>   In a conference call with reporters, Fu said the transaction wouldn't have ""any negative impact to the national security interests of the United States.... People need to understand this is a purely commercial transaction, driven by market forces and market considerations.""</p>              <p>   Chinese analysts and those connected with the government said that CNOOC's bid for El Segundo-based Unocal was an independent commercial decision made by the company, not a move directed by Beijing.</p>              <p>   ""Through an acquisition of another company, CNOOC wants to expand their business in Asia,"" said Han Wenke, vice director of the energy institute affiliated with the National Development and Reform Commission, a regulatory agency of the Chinese central government.</p>              <p>   CNOOC's move also could create crosscurrents for the Bush administration and its commitment to increased trade, free commodities markets and U.S. investment in China.</p>              <p>   Indeed, Fu said during the conference call that he believed the transaction would prevail ""with the U.S. government being the champion of global free trade ... and also with so many American companies making investments and acquisitions in China.""</p>              <p>   In addition to U.S. government approval, any acquisition also must win the favor of Unocal's stockholders, and some Wall Street analysts said CNOOC's offer didn't pass muster.</p>              <p>   ""That's not much of a premium over what Chevron's offering,"" said Gene Gillespie, an analyst with investment firm Howard Weil Inc. ""I don't think this is attractive to the Unocal shareholders,"" he said, partly because a portion of the Chevron deal would be tax-free to Unocal's investors.</p>              <p>   Fadel Gheit, senior energy analyst at investment firm Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said Unocal's investors might shoot down the deal.</p>              <p>   ""They should at least have upped it to $72"" a share, said Gheit, who owns stock in both Unocal and Chevron. ""This is a waste of everyone's time.""</p>              <p>   Still, Gheit said, ""I would not be surprised if Chevron sweetened the offer one way or another. I think Chevron is committed and interested in Unocal, and it's not going to let the deal collapse.""</p>              <p>   The risk of U.S. resistance to the deal was not lost on CNOOC, whose shares trade on the New York and Hong Kong stock exchanges.</p>              <p>   CNOOC (pronounced see-nook) said the offer was ""friendly"" and that it hoped to reach a ""consensual"" deal. The company also said it would continue Unocal's practice of selling all or most of its U.S.- produced oil and natural gas in the United States, which CNOOC said accounted for less than 1% of total U.S. oil and gas consumption.</p>              <p>   However, the majority of Unocal's oil and gas is produced overseas and is sold to customers around the world. Indeed, CNOOC and Chevron both prize Unocal because of its substantial oil and gas exploration projects in the Asia Pacific region, including Thailand, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Myanmar.</p>              <p>   Chevron, based in San Ramon, Calif., and the second-largest U.S. oil company, behind Exxon Mobil Corp., is offering about $62 a share in cash and Chevron stock -- or about $17 billion -- under a friendly agreement it reached with Unocal in April. That pact received antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission this month.</p>              <p>   Despite the lower price, Chevron said its offer was still superior because it ""combines compelling value, regulatory certainty and accelerated timing"" for Unocal's stockholders, while the ""CNOOC proposal must undergo an extensive regulatory process in the United States and elsewhere.""</p>              <p>   Chevron declined to comment on whether it might sweeten its proposal, as some analysts have predicted in the event CNOOC joined the fray. Unocal said that its directors continued to recommend that its stockholders approve the deal with Chevron, but that they would ""evaluate the CNOOC proposal"" because of their fiduciary duty to investors.</p>              <p>   As part of their agreement, Unocal and Chevron have a ""breakup"" clause under which another acquirer of Unocal would have to pay $500 million to Chevron. The fee is designed to thwart other suitors.</p>              <p>   Before CNOOC's announcement late Wednesday, which had been rumored for days, Unocal's stock rose a penny to $64.86 a share, while Chevron's stock fell 51 cents to $58.27.</p>              <p>   Unocal, a 115-year-old company that was founded in California, once was known for its Union 76 gasoline. But it sold its retail and refining operations in 1997 to focus on exploration and production.</p>              <p>   Unocal also operates in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caspian Sea area, and about 66% of its sales come from foreign sites. Bolstered by high oil and gas prices, Unocal last year earned a $1.2 billion, a record profit for the company, and had sales of $8.2 billion.</p>              <p>   The company's fields are strategically attractive to CNOOC because the Chinese company is aggressively looking for additional reserves. China is now the world's second-largest consumer of oil, after the United States.</p>              <p>   Stephen Leeb, president of Leeb Capital Management in New York, which owns some Unocal shares, called CNOOC's offer ""gutsy"" because the Chinese ""realize the political ramifications of making a bid.""</p>              <p>   ""That they would be willing to pay half a billion dollars to Chevron, and to court Senate disapprobation, it shows how desperate China is for oil assets,"" said Leeb, who also wrote a 2004 book called ""The Oil Factor.""</p>              <p>   CNOOC's financial advisors on the offer include the U.S. investment firms Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and J.P.

"309","2005-07-04","Chinese CEO Defends Oil Bid as U.S.-Style; Foes of CNOOC's offer for Unocal don't understand energy markets or China's economic reforms, Fu Chengyu says.","422046316","Los Angeles Times","C.1","            >                                        >                          <p>   As Fu Chengyu sees it, the political maelstrom brewing in Washington over his Chinese oil company's bid to buy Unocal Corp. stems from a misunderstanding of global oil markets and the deep reforms that have taken place in China over the last two decades.</p>              <p>   The chief executive of CNOOC Ltd. said those opposing the $18.5- billion offer because of national security concerns might simply be ""scared and surprised"" by China's rapid rise in the world.</p>              <p>   ""The Chinese people and government are learning from the U.S. We are adopting the free-trade system very quickly, even though it's not perfect,"" Fu said Friday in an interview, speaking in English. He cited his company as an example: ""We are using U.S. bankers, advisors, exactly meeting the processes of U.S. market requirements"" for mergers and acquisitions.</p>              <p>   If CNOOC's bid for Unocal is thwarted by politicians, Fu says, it will send a powerful message to the Chinese and the rest of the world. ""Suddenly, [it would be as if] we found out that our teachers [of free trade] said that what they told us was not workable.""</p>              <p>   He said China would not hoard Unocal's reserves of oil and natural gas because doing so would require shipping them long distances, at high cost, or breaking long-term contracts.</p>              <p>   Fu's comments came shortly after the U.S. House of Representatives passed two measures late Thursday, Washington time, aimed at blocking CNOOC's proposed takeover of El Segundo-based Unocal. One was a resolution expressing concern that such an acquisition could harm U.S. national security. The other, an amendment to an appropriations bill, seeks to prevent the Bush administration from using federal funds to approve the Chinese bid, which topped a $16.5-billion offer made by Chevron Corp. in April.</p>              <p>   Other Chinese have raised the specter of a backlash if CNOOC's bid is derailed by politics. ""The consequence will be all the other Chinese companies will despise the Western game rules,"" said Han Xiaoping, general manager of Falcon Power Ltd., a consulting firm in Beijing.</p>              <p>   CNOOC said Friday that it had filed papers with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a multiagency group led by Treasury Secretary John W. Snow that examines proposed deals by foreign entities from a national security point of view. CNOOC is seeking an expeditious review. Unocal shareholders are set to vote Aug. 10 on Chevron's bid.</p>              <p>   CNOOC's offer, unveiled two weeks ago, has engendered considerable opposition from those who say the oil company is simply an agent of the Chinese government. CNOOC's stock is listed in Hong Kong and New York, and 71% of its shares are owned by state- controlled China National Offshore Oil Corp.</p>              <p>   During the interview on the 23rd floor of CNOOC's Beijing office tower, Fu wouldn't say precisely what role the Chinese government had in CNOOC's bid for Unocal. Most China analysts believe that at the very least, Beijing signed off on the decision. A state-owned bank has agreed to provide CNOOC with $6 billion in loans to finance the purchase.</p>              <p>   ""It's a political decision. Nobody in China can write a check"" that big, said Oded Shenkar, a management professor at Ohio State University and author of ""The Chinese Century.""</p>              <p>   For the Chinese, Shenkar said, this kind of aggressive bid ""makes their hands stronger in negotiations"" with the United States over trade. ""This is another card, another joker that they pick up. It sends a signal that they mean business and are not going to be a passive player.""</p>              <p>   Fu stressed, however, that the government ""cannot make business decisions on behalf of management, or replace our decision with theirs. Never.""</p>              <p>   ""This is what has changed in China over the last 20 years,"" the 54-year-old Fu said. ""Even though the government has ownership, operating the assets is purely the right of the business unit. It is similar to [any] public company,"" he added. ""The ownership is shareholders. But who runs the assets? The management.""</p>              <p>   Fu, who earned a master's in petroleum engineering at USC, took issue with those contending that a Chinese company's takeover of Unocal would threaten America's security. Some have raised fears that China, which has been hunting for energy around the globe, is trying to hoard oil resources for itself.</p>              <p>   Unocal, though, is a small player in oil; the company's assets are predominantly natural gas, mostly in Asia. Overall, Unocal's U.S. production accounts for less than 1% of total American consumption of oil and gas. At any rate, Fu reiterated a pledge to continue delivering Unocal oil to the U.S. and other countries that get it now. While it's true that China needs oil, Fu said, in today's world, where crude is traded freely, economics and local rules dictate where oil is shipped.</p>              <p>   ""The Unocal assets in the world cannot be delivered to China, because most will be supplied to the local market,"" said Fu. ""You have to look at the economics.... Shipping oil from far distances will cost more than from short distances.""</p>              <p>   He added that most of Unocal's assets were natural gas properties, which are locked up in long-term contracts with countries such as Thailand and Bangladesh. Even if the countries where those assets are located would grant permission, analysts say it wouldn't be easy to build pipelines to reroute supplies to China.</p>              <p>   Fu also dismissed concerns that the Chinese would use Unocal's deep-water drilling technology for military use, such as testing of nuclear weapons. U.S. experts have said such threats seem dubious.</p>              <p>   Fu went further, calling them the ""imaginations"" of people unfamiliar with the industry. ""Such technology has existed for many years,"" he said. ""Have you heard any countries using this"" for military purposes?</p>              <p>   Fu said he stood ready to explain this and other issues to U.S. politicians directly. And he reiterated a commitment to address any conflicts that CNOOC's proposal might have with U.S. security requirements.</p>              <p>   ""We believe this is pure commercial,"" Fu said.

"310","2005-07-01","House Says No to China Oil Deal","422049542","Los Angeles Times","C.1","            >                                        >                          <p>   Voicing concern about national security and the U.S. economy, the House of Representatives passed two measures Thursday aimed at blocking the proposed takeover of El Segundo-based Unocal Corp. by a Chinese oil company.</p>              <p>   In a strong bipartisan vote of 333 to 92, the House approved an amendment to a Treasury Department spending bill forbidding the administration from using federal funds to approve the bid by CNOOC Ltd., an arm of government-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp., to buy Unocal for $18.5 billion.</p>              <p>   The Treasury Department reviews proposals for significant foreign investment in U.S. companies to ensure that national security isn't damaged, a process that would involve use of federal funds. The review is conducted through the multi-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which has seldom blocked foreign investments or mergers.</p>              <p>   But more important than its specific terms, the amendment, sponsored by Rep. Carolyn C. Kilpatrick (D-Mich.), was a vehicle for expressing congressional displeasure at the proposal.</p>              <p>   ""Why do we want to sell our oil to a global economic competitor?"" Kilpatrick said. ""Americans deserve a thorough government evaluation of the implications of Unocal's takeover by one of our chief economic competitors.""</p>              <p>   Although the amendment was passed, it could be changed or removed when members of the House and the Senate meet to reconcile their versions of the legislation.</p>              <p>   In a separate action, the House approved a resolution, in a late- night 398-15 vote, expressing the chamber's concern that the proposed buyout ""could threaten to impair the national security of the United States"" and asking the president to initiate a review if the companies proceed.</p>              <p>   ""I believe it is imperative that the United States protect its access to Unocal's energy resources in order to protect our economy and our national security,"" said Rep. Richard W. Pombo (R-Tracy), who sponsored the resolution.</p>              <p>   Opponents of the resolution argued that permitting the Chinese to buy Unocal was only fair, considering that China is one of the largest holders of U.S. debt. They also noted that Unocal supplies only about 1% of the country's petroleum.</p>              <p>   ""This resolution basically missed the point,"" said Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.). ""The problem we have now is ... we are as addicted to the Chinese loans, to their credit to us, as we are to Saudi oil.""</p>              <p>   Unocal's board is weighing competing offers from CNOOC and Chevron Corp. of San Ramon, Calif., which is in Pombo's congressional district. CNOOC's $18.5-billion, all-cash offer for Unocal is equal to $67 a share.</p>              <p>   The value of Chevron's cash-and-stock offer changes daily with the price of Chevron's stock. Chevron's shares closed Thursday at $55.92, down 84 cents, making its Unocal bid worth about $59.45 a share, or $16.2 billion. Unocal shares closed at $65.05, down 15 cents, and CNOOC's U.S.-traded shares closed at $59.32, up 7 cents.</p>              <p>   ""Today's resolution calls for what CNOOC has been suggesting all along, namely, a thorough review of the transaction,"" said Mark Palmer, a U.S. representative for the Chinese company. ""Despite the heated rhetoric, we firmly believe the [Treasury review] process will be fair, thorough and not influenced by either emotion or politics.""</p>              <p>   The Chinese company has pledged to sell Unocal's U.S.-produced oil and natural gas within the United States. Unocal owns substantial reserves in Asia, and the Chinese government is eager to find long-term sources of fuel for its growing economy.</p>              <p>   Chevron spokesman Don Campbell said the company appreciated ""the open and vigorous debate"" in Congress, and he repeated the company's contention that the CNOOC offer was being unfairly subsidized through cheap financing from Chinese-government-related entities.</p>              <p>   Also Thursday, Unocal said high energy prices boosted its second- quarter profit more than 20% above analyst expectations. Unocal said it would report after-tax second-quarter income, excluding some items, of $1.65 to $1.70 a share Aug. 1, exceeding the average estimate of $1.36 a share from analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.</p>              <p>   *</p>              <p>   Times staff writer Elizabeth Douglass contributed to this report.</p>              <p> Credit: Times Staff Writer</p>                      "

In fact, TCL combined its TV operation with Thomson's TV operation, not with all of Thomson. The deal did not include TCL's DVD division.</p>              <p>   Flush with cash and a strong desire to expand their global reach, Chinese companies have stepped up their shopping spree to acquire U.S. assets, highlighted Tuesday by reports of a possible bid for Unocal Corp. and an offer for Maytag Corp.</p>              <p>   Mainland Chinese investments in the United States have been relatively small, attracting little attention. But analysts predict that China's growing visibility could spark a backlash reminiscent of anti-Japan sentiments that arose two decades ago, given concerns on Capitol Hill that China represents a serious economic threat and future military challenger.</p>              <p>   Chinese acquisitions of American strategic assets such as oil reserves will require vetting by the U.S. government and could aggravate tensions in Congress over the bulging U.S. trade deficit with China and that country's reluctance to revalue its currency, analysts say. U.S. firms complain that the Chinese yuan is undervalued by as much as 40%, giving China an unfair trade advantage by making its exports cheaper.</p>              <p>   ""There's going to be a fuss about this in Washington for sure, and I don't think it is a foregone conclusion that Washington would say yes"" to a Unocal deal, said Donald Straszheim, chairman of Straszheim Global Advisors, a consulting firm focused on China. ""But I see no reason why it's not reasonable to have Chinese companies investing in American companies, just like we're happy to have Russian companies investing here or British companies investing here.""</p>              <p>   Although China has long welcomed foreign funds, the Beijing regime is opening the nation's doors wider to U.S. investment in previously closed sectors such as financial services and transportation. Last week, Bank of America Corp. announced that it was investing $3 billion for a 9% stake in China Construction Bank, one of China's largest banks.</p>              <p>   On Tuesday, Unocal's stock rose $1.38 to $64.85 amid reports that CNOOC Ltd., China's largest offshore oil and gas producer, may offer $20 billion for Unocal, which would outbid Chevron Corp. Early today, Reuters quoted a CNOOC executive as saying that no decision had been made on whether to bid.</p>              <p>   Also Tuesday, Haier Group, China's largest refrigerator maker, and two U.S. buyout firms offered $1.28 billion for Maytag, topping an earlier bid by Ripplewood Holdings. Maytag's stock rose 86 cents to $16.09.</p>              <p>   Those possible deals, along with the $1.25-billion purchase in December by China's Lenovo Group Ltd. of IBM Corp.'s personal computer division, are the cutting edge of a new wave of overseas investment involving powerful but little-known Chinese companies.</p>              <p>   They are seeking to acquire badly needed natural resources or move beyond their low-cost manufacturing base, said Donald Tang, chairman of Bear Stearns Asia. The path is a well-trodden one, used by companies from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to get U.S. toeholds.</p>              <p>   By purchasing global management expertise, technology, brand- name visibility and marketing networks, Chinese firms can leapfrog competitors, boost profit margins and bolster their attractiveness to consumers and investors.</p>              <p>   Outside of natural resources, the most likely acquisition targets are U.S. companies involved in consumer electronics, appliances or high technology, in which China has already mastered manufacturing skills, analysts say.</p>              <p>   Haier's bid for Maytag, like Lenovo's purchase of IBM's PC division, are examples of this trend. Haier opened a refrigerator factory in Camden, S.C., in 2000 but has been struggling to expand sales in the competitive U.S. market.</p>              <p>   ""Once you have the technology, the manufacturing know-how and the brand name, the competitive landscape will be changed,"" said Tang, who also heads the Asia Society's Southern California branch.</p>              <p>   Tony Luh, managing director and co-founder of Dragon Venture Inc., a San Jose-based venture capital firm specializing in China, said the U.S. telecommunications sector was a likely place for future purchases, given the aggressive expansion efforts of Huawei Technologies Co., China's leading telecom firm. Huawei is reportedly considering a bid for Britain's Marconi, which is up for sale.</p>              <p>   China's growing need for strategic resources such as oil or iron ore is also driving its investment push. China is already the world's second-largest oil consumer, after the U.S., and a leading buyer of coal, steel and other commodities needed to fuel its export- oriented factories and domestic building boom.</p>              <p>   CNOOC has yet to make public its intentions for Unocal. Wall Street, however, was rife with rumors Tuesday that the government- controlled oil company would offer to pay $71.50 a share in cash to snatch Unocal away from Chevron.</p>              <p>   A spokesman for El Segundo-based Unocal declined to comment on the speculation.</p>              <p>   Chevron spokesman Donald Campbell said the company couldn't comment on the possible actions of another company. He did say, however, that Chevron's commitment to buying Unocal was unwavering, and ""the offer accepted by the Unocal board is attractive and has a high degree of certainty as to completion.""</p>              <p>   Under terms of a deal announced April 4, San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron agreed to pay about $62 in cash and stock for each Unocal share. The total value of the deal, which fluctuates with the price of Chevron's stock, was pegged at $16.4 billion when the acquisition was announced.</p>              <p>   The CNOOC bid, if successful, would be the first mainland Chinese entry into the politically sensitive U.S. oil sector. But China's leading state-owned companies have been investing heavily in oil, natural gas and mineral projects around the world, including recent deals in the Canadian oil sands, reportedly the largest oil reserve after Saudi Arabia.</p>              <p>   And in late 2003, China's Laiwu Steel Group teamed up with Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., a Cleveland-based mining firm, to reopen a bankrupt iron ore mine in an economically depressed region of northern Minnesota.</p>              <p>   Local officials and the steelworker union welcomed the Laiwu deal, which not only helped resurrect a mine that now employs 425 people but also saved more than 100 railroad and shipping jobs in the region. To date, the partnership has agreed to invest more than $35 million for equipment and an expanded production line, said Rep. James L. Oberstar (D-Minn.), who helped engineer the deal.</p>              <p>   ""If it keeps jobs here, it's damn good,"" he said, when asked about Chinese investments in the U.S. economy.</p>              <p>   But critics of China vowed to increase pressure on the Bush administration to look more critically at China's investments in the U.S. In the late 1990s, they foiled an effort by China Ocean Shipping Co., China's giant state-owned shipping firm, to take over a closed Navy base at the Port of Long Beach, alleging that the Chinese could use that facility as a base for spying.</p>              <p>   Rep. Richard W. Pombo (R-Tracy) and Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-El Cajon) sent a letter Friday to President Bush urging him to initiate a review of China's expansion in the energy arena, including any future bid by CNOOC for Unocal. Under U.S. law, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a Treasury Department panel, is responsible for vetting any foreign purchases that could threaten U.S. security.</p>              <p>   C. Richard D'Amato, chairman of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a congressional committee that has been sharply critical of U.S. policy toward China, said the implications of expanded Chinese investment were troubling because of the potential for future conflicts with that growing Asian power.</p>              <p>   In addition to the security issues, he said, the U.S. government should consider the long-term threat to U.S. competitiveness.</p>              <p>   ""One danger, to put it bluntly, is that they can loot these companies and move that technology and know-how to China over time,"" he said.</p>              <p>   *</p>              <p>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</p>              <p>   China's growing global interest</p>              <p>   The Asian nation's appetite for foreign companies, particularly those in the United States, is getting bigger.

"312","2005-07-05","Panel Has a Big Say in Foreign Purchases; Security clearance for a Chinese bid for Unocal would hinge on an obscure U.S. committee.","422059277","Los Angeles Times","C.1","            >                                        >                          <p>   When a Dutch company sought to take over Silicon Valley Group Inc., a high-tech firm in San Jose, the ultimate vote was cast not by shareholders or executives or even the board of directors.</p>              <p>   That job went to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a secretive, little-known panel of U.S. officials that rules on whether purchases of U.S. businesses by foreign entities would impair national security and should be banned.</p>              <p>   The committee approved the $1.6-billion purchase in 2001, but only after setting conditions for the deal, including that the foreign owner -- ASM Lithography Holding -- unload one of the California firm's assets, a laboratory that produced optical components for spy satellites.</p>              <p>   ""If they can, they'll work out a deal with the company,"" explained James Andrew Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, of the influential U.S. panel. ""If they want to deter a purchase, that's usually what happens.""</p>              <p>   The obscure committee known as CFIUS may face a high-profile decision in the near future: The Chinese bid to buy El Segundo- based Unocal Corp. appears likely to trigger a national security review unless the process is derailed by Congress.</p>              <p>   House members voted Thursday to block the government from spending money to recommend approval of the bid by CNOOC Ltd., an arm of government-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp. -- a backdoor way to block a CFIUS investigation. It was not immediately clear how such a proposal would fare in the Senate or how it would affect administration policy.</p>              <p>   House members who oppose the Unocal takeover fear that the panel would approve the deal, and they want to stop the process in its tracks.</p>              <p>   The Chinese firm -- which is trying to trump Chevron Corp.'s previously announced deal for Unocal -- had formally requested a review before the vote Thursday.</p>              <p>   CNOOC representatives contend that an investigation would put to rest any fears that the takeover poses a security threat to the U.S. The company also wants any objections dealt with before the acquisition goes further, and it has suggested that it might sell certain Unocal properties, including pipeline and storage assets, to satisfy the government panel.</p>              <p>   ""There's a long-proven process for reviewing foreign investment in the United States,"" said Mark Palmer, a U.S. spokesman for the Chinese firm. ""We believe the process will be thorough and fair, and in the end it will not be influenced by emotion or politics.""</p>              <p>   Should that process move forward, the Chinese firm will face a 12- member committee composed of some of the most powerful officials in the U.S. government, starting with the chairman, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow. Other members include the secretaries of Defense, State, Homeland Security and Commerce, the attorney general and the director of the Office of Management and Budget.</p>              <p>   Membership is set by law, as are strong rules on confidentiality. The panel is not even supposed to acknowledge when a review is underway.</p>              <p>   The mandate is purposely broad, as committee members consider whether there is ""credible evidence"" that a foreign investor might take action ""that threatens to impair the national security."" Issues of national defense, law enforcement concerns and terrorism all may be weighed against the economic pros and cons of a deal.</p>              <p>   If substantial questions exist, the panel conducts an investigation and makes a recommendation to the White House.</p>              <p>   ""The president has a ton of discretion in making a decision on whether or not to block a deal,"" said Todd M. Malan, executive director of the Organization for International Investment, which represents foreign firms that have stakes in the U.S.</p>              <p>   Intelligence, criminal justice and other officials may take an active role in cases, even negotiating side deals with foreign parties. In contentious cases, such as the Unocal offer, members of Congress invariably weigh in and the issues are discussed at the pinnacle of government.</p>              <p>   ""Some people would like you to believe it's nameless, faceless bureaucrats in the basement of some building,"" Malan said, alluding to the small committee staff that is housed a block away from the Treasury Department. ""It's not. When they get together on a high- profile deal like this, it's probably in the Cabinet room in the White House.""</p>              <p>   The panel was created in 1988, an era when U.S. economic anxieties centered on Japan. Since then, the panel has taken a look at more than 1,500 cases. Just 25 led to full-scale investigations, and it issued a flat-out ban only once -- preventing a Chinese bid for a U.S. aircraft parts maker in 1990. U.S. officials blocked the sale of Seattle-based Mamco Manufacturing Co. to a Chinese military procurement firm that was accused of past efforts to steal Western aerospace technology.</p>              <p>   Rather than veto a deal, the committee is more likely to demand safeguards, such as instructing a foreign purchaser to accept American board members, pledge future cooperation with law enforcement or sell off certain parts of the new acquisition. Its investigations are limited to 45 days, but that prospect sometimes prompts foreign investors to back off altogether.</p>              <p>   In recent years, technology and terrorism have altered the national security equation and debates in the committee.</p>              <p>   Foreign takeovers in telecommunications, for example, touch off fears that U.S. law enforcement will lose access to wiretaps and electronic data -- or that unfriendly foreign powers may gain a platform to spy on the United States.</p>              <p>   In 2000, the committee allowed Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp. to go ahead with its purchase of Verio Inc., an Internet service provider, but only after obtaining a strict ban on Japanese government involvement in the American firm.</p>              <p>   Similar fears were prompted by the 2003 effort of two companies - - Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. of Hong Kong and Singapore Technologies Telemedia -- to buy fiber-optic network provider Global Crossing Ltd.</p>              <p>   U.S. officials were concerned that foreign ownership of the fiber- optic network might make the government vulnerable to eavesdropping from overseas. In addition, members of Congress contended that Hutchison Whampoa had ties to the Chinese military.</p>              <p>   To defuse the concerns, Hutchison Whampoa offered to play a passive role in the company. But the committee proceeded with plans to conduct a 45-day investigation. At that point, the Chinese firm backed out. Ultimately, the panel allowed Singapore Technologies -- which offered to put Americans on the Global Crossing board -- to make the purchase on its own.</p>              <p>   Technology is not always a deal breaker. In March, the U.S. panel approved the sale of IBM Corp.'s personal computer division to Lenovo Group of China. Among the concerns were whether Lenovo would have access to IBM government contracts that might prove useful to Chinese intelligence.</p>              <p>   The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, also have left a mark on the committee. The secretary of Homeland Security became a member in 2003. Also, the frequency of investigations has increased since Sept. 11.</p>              <p>   ""That's different. That's new,"" Lewis, of the Center for Strategic Studies, said of the new weight being given to potential risks to the nation's infrastructure.</p>              <p>   Experts are divided on whether the Chinese bid for Unocal poses serious issues of national security.</p>              <p>   ""The more energy resources they lock up, the more marbles they take off the table, as energy demand rises,"" said Michael R. Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. ""This transaction needs to go through careful scrutiny.""</p>              <p>   But Roger Cliff, a Chinese military specialist at think tank Rand Corp., said it was a stretch to say that control of Unocal would pose a security threat to the U.S.</p>              <p>   ""Sure, China could use the fact that it owns Unocal to slow down production and create a short-term crunch in energy supplies in the U.S.,"" he said.

Schoenfeld Asset Management, wrote that ""it is your duty to maximize value for stockholders,"" and that ""It is a violation of ... law for fiduciaries to enter into agreements that bar them from obtaining materially higher offers.""</p>              <p>   Schoenfeld's firm, which has offices in New York and London, invests money for pension funds and universities and controls less than 1% of the outstanding Unocal shares.</p>              <p>   On July 20, Chinese oil firm CNOOC Ltd said it had no plans to increase its bid after El Segundo-based Unocal snubbed the Chinese bid in favor of a sweetened bid by rival San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron valued at about $17 billion.</p>              <p>   Although CNOOC's bid is higher than Chevron's, analysts have said it needs to be even higher to offset the risk to Unocal shareholders that the deal could be delayed or blocked by the U.S. government because of national security concerns. The Chinese government controls China National Offshore Oil Corp., which holds a 71% stake in publicly traded CNOOC.</p>              <p>   ""We have received the letter, but we cannot comment,"" said Barry Lane, spokesman for Unocal, whose board has recommended that the Chevron bid be accepted at a special meeting scheduled for Aug. 10.</p>              <p>   The Schoenfeld letter threatens legal action, telling the board ""If you, as our fiduciary, persist in what we understand to be your refusal to seek to obtain an even higher offer from CNOOC and to take all steps necessary to procure that offer, including lobbying in Congress and at the White House, you will be personally liable to your stockholders for the lost premiums. Those damages will be at least several billion dollars.""</p>              <p>   CNOOC in June offered to buy Unocal for $67 a share in cash, easily topping Unocal's April 4 agreement to be acquired by Chevron in a stock-and-cash deal initially for $62 a share. Analysts have said CNOOC needs to raise its bid to $70 a share to win the deal.</p>              <p>   In an interview late Sunday, Schoenfeld said he took the unusual step of writing a letter because of his concerns about political interference.</p>              <p>   In Washington, lawmakers have called for additional studies regarding China's energy policy prior to a government committee review of a possible deal. On July 20, the Senate approved a provision from Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) to require a State Department report before a foreign, government-owned company could acquire a U.S. company.</p>              <p>   ""From our perspective it looks like a clear attempt to create a timing advantage for Chevron and stymie the bidding,"" Schoenfeld said.

"314","2005-07-04","The Nation; Ronald Brownstein / WASHINGTON OUTLOOK; China May Fuel Global Risks if U.S. Fails to Push Conservation","422079844","Los Angeles Times","A.14","            >                                        >                          <p>   Both countries might be better off if the United States encouraged China to invest in hydrogen fuel cells or solar energy rather than an American oil company.</p>              <p>   Since CNOOC Ltd., an oil company owned mostly by the Chinese government, made its unsolicited $18.5-billion bid for California- based Unocal Corp. last month, the Washington debate has revolved mostly around the deal's economic and national security implications.</p>              <p>   But the energy and environmental ramifications may justify far more concern. The acquisition attempt, which the Unocal board is studying, suggests that China is anticipating enormous increases in its consumption of fossil fuels. The direct result for the United States and other nations could be a threatening rise in the carbon dioxide emissions associated with global warming, as well as higher gas prices at the pump.</p>              <p>   ""The more their demand, the higher oil and gas prices are going to go here,"" says Michael R. Wessel, a member of the congressionally chartered U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission. ""All people have to do is look at the $2.50 a gallon for gas they spend on their summer vacation to realize that the China problem is here to stay.""</p>              <p>   Chinese demand isn't the only cause of rising gas prices, of course. China uses far less energy per person than the United States or other Western nations. But it is much less efficient in its energy use than major industrialized nations, partly because it relies so heavily on coal to generate electric power.</p>              <p>   China requires about three times as much energy as the United States to produce $1 in economic output. It emits nearly four times as much carbon dioxide per dollar of economic activity as the United States. That means that as China's rapid economic growth continues, its demand for energy and its contribution to global warming will skyrocket.</p>              <p>   China consumes 40% as much energy as the United States. The U.S. Energy Information Administration, the government's source for energy statistics, projects that over the next 20 years, that ratio will rise to two-thirds. China has moved past Japan into second place (behind the United States) among the world's largest oil importers. With new cars flooding China's roads, the agency projects that through 2025, the country's oil consumption will increase 2 1/ 2 times faster per year than the average for the industrialized Western nations.</p>              <p>   The Chinese are feeling the environmental implications of these trends first, with heavy traffic and thick pollution in their major cities. But China's energy use could affect people around the world by accelerating global warming.</p>              <p>   China was exempted from reductions required by the Kyoto Protocol on global warming because it was classified as a developing country. But if China can't reduce the growth of its carbon emissions, it could overwhelm efforts to control them elsewhere. The Energy Information Administration forecasts that from 1990 through 2025, China's total carbon emissions will rise more than the combined increase for the United States, Western Europe and Japan.</p>              <p>   The most frightening part is that such forecasts may be optimistic. They assume that China over time will produce each dollar of economic output with less energy and carbon emissions. That's been the pattern until recently. But Jeffrey Logan, China program manager for the International Energy Agency in Paris, points out the most recent Chinese figures show energy efficiency declining as the nation continues an energy-intensive boom in housing, industrial and road construction. ""That's tremendously scary,"" Logan says.</p>              <p>   Experts like Logan and David Jhirad, vice president for science and research at the World Resources Institute, say the Chinese government is genuinely concerned about these trends. Chinese officials are shifting more reliance for power generation from coal to cleaner sources such as natural gas and hydropower. Last fall, China adopted automotive fuel economy standards slightly more stringent than those in the United States. And China is cooperating with the United States on joint programs to study ""clean coal"" and other green energy approaches.</p>              <p>   The problem is that these efforts don't remotely match the scale of the problem. China, for instance, deserves credit for imposing fuel economy standards marginally tougher than America's. But China projects that by 2020, the number of cars and trucks on its roads will increase sevenfold, to 140 million. Against that tide, slightly exceeding the modest U.S. standards seems the equivalent of raising a dam 6 inches to protect against a tsunami.</p>              <p>   China needs to think more boldly. As the Unocal bid suggests, China now expects to rely primarily on the same fossil fuel-based strategy as nations, such as the United States or Germany, that industrialized over a century ago. But China could contribute enormously to the global environment, the sustainability of world oil supplies and the health of its own citizens by working to leapfrog to cleaner 21st century energy technologies -- like wind and solar energy for electricity, hybrid cars and ultimately vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells that emit only water and heat.</p>              <p>   ""There is a need in China for much more than just an incremental improvement in efficiency,"" says Jhirad, who dealt with international energy issues in the Clinton administration. ""There is a need for considering revolutionary approaches.""</p>              <p>   Admittedly, the United States lacks much standing to demand more energy efficiency from anyone. While completing an energy bill last month, the Senate rejected mandatory reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and tougher fuel economy standards. President Bush continues to minimize the dangers of global warming.</p>              <p>   Those decisions strip America of its power of example -- its best tool to promote transformative energy changes in China that would benefit the United States too. If America clings to the energy strategies of the past, it won't have the leverage to nudge China and other rising economic powers toward the fuels of the future.</p>              <p>   *</p>              <p>   Ronald Brownstein's column appears every Monday.

"315","2006-05-04","Q&A; Chinese Computer Giant Showcases Capitalist Credentials; Chairman of Lenovo, which acquired IBM's PC unit, says the firm has few government ties.","422117345","Los Angeles Times","C.1","            >                                        >                          <p>   Yang Yuanqing heads the world's third-largest maker of personal computers. But few in the United States have ever heard of him -- or his company, for that matter.</p>              <p>   Lenovo Group aims to change that. Since the Chinese company bought IBM Corp.'s PC business last year for $1.25 billion, the company has moved quickly to establish itself as a global brand.</p>              <p>   To that end, Lenovo signed on as the official computer sponsor of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, and the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.</p>              <p>   Lenovo made the acquisition amid a backlash in Congress against Chinese companies trying to purchase American corporations. Chinese oil company CNOOC Ltd. ditched its attempt to buy Unocal Corp. and appliance maker Haier Group ended its effort to join two U.S. firms to acquire Maytag Corp.</p>              <p>   Lenovo has moved its global headquarters to Purchase, N.Y., and kept most of its ex-IBM development staff in North Carolina. The company has brought its ThinkPad laptop line to U.S. retail stores and plans to sell Lenovo PCs to small and medium-sized businesses.</p>              <p>   Yang, Lenovo's 42-year-old chairman, was in the U.S. recently while Chinese President Hu Jintao was making an official visit. He spoke with journalists in San Francisco at the annual convention of the Committee of 100, a group of Chinese American business and civic leaders.</p>              <p>   Question: How is Lenovo doing in the United States? Do consumers here know the brand?</p>              <p>   Answer: I don't think so. We are a new company, but so far we are satisfied with our performance because we are keeping the business very stable. This is our first target. Maybe for the next step we should consider how to grow. We recruited a new CEO [former Dell Inc. executive William Amelio], and I believe he will lead this group not only for the U.S. market but also the worldwide market.</p>              <p>   Q: Do you worry about any stigma associated with being a Chinese company in the minds of American consumers?</p>              <p>   A: I'm not worried about the public. I'm a little bit worried about the government. For the past couple of weeks, there have been some articles related to procurement of our PCs by the State Department.</p>              <p>   Our company is a 100% market-oriented company. Some people have said we are a state-owned enterprise. It's 100% not true. In 1984 the Chinese Academy of Sciences only invested $25,000 in our company. The purpose of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to invest in this company was that they wanted to commercialize their research results. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is a pure research entity in China, owned by the government. From this point, you could say we're different from state-owned enterprises.</p>              <p>   Secondly, after this investment, this company is run totally by the founders and management team. The government has never been involved in our daily operation, in important decisions, strategic direction, nomination of the CEO and top executives and financial management. Everything is done by our management team.</p>              <p>   The third thing is actually we were the first group Chinese company to be listed in the Hong Kong market, which is a totally free market. We were the first group of Chinese companies to adopt a high standard of corporate governance and diversified shareholder structure to get foreign investors in our company.</p>              <p>   Q: How will you enter the U.S. market and gain share?</p>              <p>   A: The IBM PC business had some presence in the U.S. But they only cover large enterprise customers, so-called relationship customers. It's a very limited customer base. So in the future, we will try to keep ThinkPad as a high premier brand to continue to sell to this customer base. In the meantime, we will have the Lenovo brand to cover small and medium businesses and maybe consumers.</p>              <p>   Q: Will you sell Lenovo computers to U.S. consumers this year?</p>              <p>   A: It will not be so fast. We asked our team in the U.S. to focus on the commercial segment first.</p>              <p>   Q: Will you do more deals like the kiosks Lenovo has in Best Buy, where selected models are for sale?</p>              <p>   A: So far we haven't had this thought. We sell to [small and medium business] customers through Best Buy. Right now, we have no consumer product line to be launched in the U.S. The Lenovo 3000 product line is mainly for [that] segment. It's a good test. I think if we can have success with Best Buy, that can give us a lot of experience.</p>              <p>   Q: Are you structured more as a Chinese company or as a Western multinational?</p>              <p>   A: Lenovo was one of the first companies that awarded our founders and management shares and gave our employees stock options. So I think these incentives helped our company compete in the market.</p>              <p>   Since we acquired the IBM PC business, we became a multinational company. Right now, our shareholder structure is very diversified, so we have the Chinese Academy of Sciences, IBM and some private equity companies as shareholders.</p>              <p>   And we have a very international board. On our board, there is no representative of the government, including the Chinese Academy of Sciences, whose purpose is not controlling this company but getting a return from the company. Right now, they are very happy -- they only invested 25,000 U.S. dollars, but every year they can get a couple of times that in dividend. So it's totally capitalist.</p>              <p>   Q: Does the direct model work in China?</p>              <p>   A: The direct model is good for relationship customers. But especially for small cities in China, if you want to use a direct model, it doesn't work. For consumers, they want to look and feel the machine. After they feel better, they will decide to buy. Also they want to get the machine immediately after their payment. They cannot wait three days or one week to get the machine. So you have to have inventory in your retail shops.</p>              <p>   Q: How big can the Lenovo brand be in the U.S.?</p>              <p>   A: Certainly we wish our brand will be among the top-level PC brands. Certainly we have a long way to go.</p>              <p>   Q: You're already No. 3 in the world.</p>              <p>   A: It's only related to scale. Our brand recognition is still weak, especially in the U.S. and mature markets. From one aspect, we should further leverage the IBM brand, the Think brand, to keep our business stable. From other aspects, we should build ourselves a [Lenovo] brand quickly.</p>              <p>   Q: Do you feel the center of technology inevitably moves from the U.S. to China?</p>              <p>   A: China is actually more a manufacturing-oriented country. But the government has started to pay more attention to innovation. The U.S. government gave a lot of importance to [intellectual property] protection in China, but the fact is the Chinese government started to realize if we cannot protect IP, we cannot have a better environment to encourage innovation.</p>              <div><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""41""/><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""Illustration""/><div class=""Illustration_content""><p>Caption: PHOTO: 'MARKET-ORIENTED': Yang Yuanqing, shown in August, says Lenovo adheres to high standards of corporate governance.; PHOTOGRAPHER: Paul Hilton Bloomberg News</p></div></object></div>              <p> Credit: Times Staff Writer</p>                      "

The company is best known for its commercials with chattering cows and its Holstein-print shipping boxes.</p>              <p>   By snapping up Gateway, Acer would displace Apple Inc. as the U.S.' third-largest computer seller with nearly 11% of the market, according to research firm IDC.</p>              <p>   After operating at close to break-even for several years, Gateway would get access to lower prices for its components, boosting its bottom line almost immediately, said independent analyst Roger Kay.</p>              <p>   ""Gateway won't have to live hand-to-mouth anymore,"" he said.</p>              <p>   Acer's bid of $1.90 a share represents a 57% premium over Friday's closing price. The deal is expected to close in December.</p>              <p>   Teaming with Gateway would make Acer a serious player in the U.S. market. The Taiwanese company shipped 5.2% of all PCs sold in the U.S. in the second quarter, good for fifth place just behind Gateway with 5.6%, according to IDC. They trail Dell Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Apple.</p>              <p>   ""Acer gets three big things out of this,"" Forrester Research analyst J.P. Gownder said. ""They get the Gateway.com website, where they sell computers directly to customers. They also get shelf space in retail stores like Best Buy and Circuit City, which is not easy to get. And they also get a brand name that's well recognized in the U.S.""</p>              <p>   Gateway earned its reputation decades ago as a homegrown company. Ted Waitt, then 22, and his brother Norm founded the business in an Iowa farmhouse in 1985.</p>              <p>   They sold accessories for Texas Instruments computers and later added their own line of computers.</p>              <p>   Gateway decamped to Southern California in 1998 but kept true to its Midwestern roots by continuing to package its computers in boxes with the black-and-white print of a Holstein cow.</p>              <p>   Cutthroat competition from Dell, Hewlett-Packard and others soon whittled away at Gateway's profit margins and cash reserves. The company, which had more than $1.3 billion in cash and short-term investments in 1999, ended last year with $416.3 million. Its shares have followed a steeper descent, tumbling 98% from a high of $82.38 on Nov. 16, 1999.</p>              <p>   Gateway shares gained 61 cents to $1.82 on Monday after the companies announced the planned acquisition.</p>              <p>   Reflecting the declining fortunes of Gateway and the broader PC business, Acer's bid was roughly one-tenth of the $7 billion offer from Compaq Computer Corp. that Ted Waitt turned down in 1997. Compaq has since been acquired by HP.</p>              <p>   ""The PC business in the U.S. is hypercompetitive,"" IDC analyst Richard Shim said. ""It's difficult for anybody to grow organically and squeeze out any major competition.""</p>              <p>   In addition to boosting Acer's U.S. position, the deal would strengthen the company's presence in Europe, where it already gets more than half its revenue.</p>              <p>   Gateway holds the option to buy Packard Bell, a PC vendor based in the Netherlands, from Lap Shun Hui, who also founded budget PC maker EMachines Inc. and sold it to Gateway in 2004.</p>              <p>   Gateway said Monday it would exercise that right, which would keep Packard Bell out of the hands of Acer's Chinese rival, Lenovo Group. Lenovo has been in talks to purchase Packard Bell.</p>              <p>   Acer President Gianfranco Lanci said there were no plans to lay off any of Gateway's 1,645 employees.</p>              <p>   Combining the two companies' purchasing power alone would yield $150 million in annual savings, he said.</p>              <p>   Acer plans to retain the Gateway brand and export the distinctive cow-print logo to Europe and Asia, where Acer has an established distribution network, Lanci said in an interview.</p>              <p>   ""Gateway has strong brand value,"" he said.</p>              <p>   --</p>              <p>   alex.pham@latimes.com</p>              <div><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""5""/><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""References""/><div class=""References_content""><p>Message No: 45093</p></div></object></div>              <div><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""41""/><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""Illustration""/><div class=""Illustration_content""><p>Caption: PHOTO: ATTRACTIVE DEAL: A couple take a look at a Gateway laptop computer Monday while shopping at a Best Buy store in Watertown, Mass.

"317","2005-06-26","Chinese Strength, U.S. Weakness","433075938","New York Times","4.11","            >                                        >                          <p>If China's attempt to buy an American oil company does nothing else, it should, at long last, force the United States to decide how it plans to protect its economy, husband its resources and grow in a world where it is no longer the only economic powerhouse.</p>              <p>With China on a buying binge for raw materials to feed its ever-expanding economy, it was inevitable that it would eventually go beyond the more modest corporate purchases it has already begun and make a grab for something the United States really cares about. Last week, history's biggest Communist country made the ultimate capitalist play: an $18.5 billion all-cash takeover bid by the state-controlled China National Offshore Oil Corporation for the American oil company Unocal.</p>              <p>The bid landed with the impact of an unexploded missile in Washington, where anti-China sentiment has been running high. From both sides of the aisle, members of Congress sounded the alarm that China was threatening to gobble up world energy resources. There is politics in that: Congress has an election next year and gasoline prices are already high. But whatever happens to the deal, Americans should be glad China reminded them that it is time to examine this country's economic strategy.</p>              <p>China's New Power</p>              <p>The chairman and chief executive of the Chinese company, Fu Chengyu, insisted that American national security was not an issue and called the unsolicited bid friendly. ''This transaction is purely a commercial transaction,'' he told reporters. That's a bit disingenuous considering the money he is using is mostly from the Chinese government and his company owes its first allegiance to Beijing authorities, not world markets. And it raises the interesting question of whether the China National Offshore Oil Corporation can have it both ways: playing by Chinese rules at home while taking advantage of American rules abroad to buy an American business. After all, this is a government-owned company operating in an authoritarian state that limits the ability of foreign companies to take their profits out of China.</p>              <p>''Does anybody honestly believe that the Chinese would ever let an American company take over a Chinese company?'' asked Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York. Actually, they have, although on a scale that hardly raised national security issues. Last year, Anheuser-Busch won a takeover battle for the Harbin Brewery Group.</p>              <p>The CNOOC bid is of a much higher order and deserves examination above and beyond the regulatory scrutiny normally given to corporate mergers and acquisitions. But Mr. Schumer's question ignores the way American companies have been buying up stakes in Chinese companies. Bank of America just agreed to pay $2.5 billion for a 9 percent stake in the state-run China Construction Bank. According to The Wall Street Journal, even Chevron, the rival bidder for Unocal, has a stake in a chemical plant in China and is exploring for oil in China.</p>              <p>So in some ways, the opposition to the CNOOC bid is the latest installment in the anti-China fervor already gripping Washington. There are a half-dozen proposals in Congress for across-the-board tariffs against Chinese imports, spurred in part by American manufacturers who complain that China's currency, the yuan, is undervalued, which results in cheaper Chinese goods coming into America and hurting American jobs. This comes on top of moves by the administration -- urged on by Congress and a huge trade deficit -- to forcibly stem the importing of Chinese textiles this year.</p>              <p>Beating up on the Chinese is fine for sound bites to convince voters that politicians care. But the real problem has less to do with China's current strength than America's current weakness. A far more rational approach to China's economic ascendancy would be to consider what steps the United States should be taking to protect itself and to grow.</p>              <p>America's Energy Policies</p>              <p>The national security of the United States is already at risk because the nation depends on imported oil for nearly 60 percent of its daily needs. That will only grow as demand increases and domestic supplies dwindle. Much of that oil comes from volatile countries in the Persian Gulf region, and the American money flowing there does nothing to encourage either more-balanced economic development or democracy. The rest comes from other parts of the world -- often the most unstable parts. In any case, it all contributes to America's monstrous trade deficit and worries about what would happen to the economy if some international crisis disrupted the supply.</p>              <p>The antidotes are simple. Americans need to use far less oil than they do now, which means requiring more fuel-efficient vehicles and finding an alternative to refined oil to power cars and trucks.</p>              <p>Beijing's desire for Unocal is fueled in part by the company's natural gas reserves, most of which are in Asia. The United States cannot claim much of a national security threat from that. North American gas supplies are still fairly robust if you count Canada, and the United States can always fall back on coal to keep the lights on. Coal now provides more than half of the country's electricity anyway.</p>              <p>But none of that should lead to complacency. The United States needs open, accessible markets. And no fuel source is free from the effects of rising demand around the world. Natural gas prices are rising rapidly, and Americans need more-efficient power plants and more-efficient appliances to reduce demand, just as we need to develop more-efficient transportation to reduce dependency on oil.</p>              <p>Trade, Currencies and Debt</p>              <p>Congress's fixation with devaluing China's yuan to help cut American job losses is another example of blaming China for what the United States is not doing. There is no reason to think that revaluing the yuan would lead to American job growth. Indeed, Alan Greenspan said Thursday that he saw no credible evidence that a stronger yuan would increase American manufacturing activity and jobs.</p>              <p>Instead of bashing China, Congress and the Bush administration should be putting money into bolstering retraining programs to help American workers whose jobs migrate overseas. American school systems, American parents and American students are going to have to focus on the fact that young people with mediocre educations are not going to be able to compete with energetic, educated young people in places like China.</p>              <p>The United States also cannot blame the Chinese government for the weak position that its own policies have created. The Bush administration's damaging practice of combining profligate deficit spending with huge tax cuts for the rich feeds the need for Washington to borrow hundreds of billions of dollars a year just to keep things going. China has become a major buyer of the Treasury bonds that finance that debt, and because of that, the American economy depends more and more on the willingness of our Chinese underwriters to buy and hold our Treasuries. A sudden decision by China to invest elsewhere would very likely have a far more devastating effect on the country than a withdrawal of Unocal's resources.</p>              <p>But the solution is not to blame China. It is to institute more sensible economic policies, including revoking the unnecessary gifts that President Bush has given to very wealthy Americans at tax time.</p>              <p>Despite Mr. Fu's claim about China's friendly bid, it is a contested one, coming two months after Unocal agreed to be sold to Chevron for $16.4 billion. There are many shots that remain to be fired in the trench warfare of this corporate takeover battle. China may or may not come out on top. But even if China loses this skirmish, it is part of a longer struggle, and those charged with leading America would do well to spend this time strengthening America from within. No matter how big and powerful China becomes, it is no match for the United States when this country is at its best.</p>                      "

Well, those complaints are coming back, except that the nation doing the buying is China, not Japan.</p>              <p>With the China National Offshore Oil Corporation's $18.5 billion unsolicited bid for Unocal last week, Washington bigwigs and corner-office executives are making their wrinkle lines worse fretting that the Chinese may buy another slice of America.</p>              <p>  Some cringing began earlier in the week, when the Haier Group, one of China's biggest companies, bid to acquire the Maytag Corporation, the appliance maker, for about $1.3 billion, surpassing an offer from a group of American investors. Add to that Lenovo's recent $1.75 billion acquisition of I.B.M.'s legendary personal computing business, and some would have you believe that we should be in full panic mode.</p>              <p>While there are clearly important foreign policy and trade questions raised by China's emergence as a deal maker in the United States, it is less clear that these deals -- and others that will surely follow -- are as problematic as they may appear at first.</p>              <p>Many deals with Chinese companies -- and, by extension, the Chinese government -- may actually help the United States economy, just as China has helped prop up the nation by buying Treasury bonds en masse.</p>              <p>Indeed, so far, the businesses in which China has taken an interest could be categorized as ''least likely to succeed.'' And the Chinese may eventually revive them.</p>              <p>Look at Maytag. That struggling company is a business that no other strategic rival in the world -- yes, the entire world -- was prepared to bid on. Before Haier expressed interest, the only potential buyer was a consortium of private equity players led by Ripplewood Holdings of New York. And what do you think they would likely have done with the company? The Maytag repairman would almost certainly have lost his job, along with dozens if not hundreds of others until the private equity group trimmed enough costs that it could take some cash out by flipping the business to another private equity team. This hot-potato game might have gone on for a decade or two until the company was milked of its very last dollar.</p>              <p>Haier, on the other hand, wants Maytag for its brand and its managers' experience, so it can have some help building the business. While Haier is also likely to cut jobs, pink slips will probably come much slower in the United States. And the Maytag brand, its culture and legacy will probably live on much longer.</p>              <p>Wall Street bankers who have been plying the Kennedy Airport-Beijing route say the Chinese are expected to come searching for more underperformers in the United States. Not so much for their current business prospects, but for the overnight brand awareness and legitimacy they lend. Just as important, they want American managements and their institutional memory to help guide them.</p>              <p>The sale of I.B.M.'s PC business to Lenovo, which also had some of those Washingtonians in a huff talking about national security issues, is a perfect example of a deal in which a Chinese company wanted American management and skill. After all, the product itself -- I.B.M.'s PC -- was going nowhere fast.</p>              <p>And if these companies are really going to die anyway, the Chinese will be left holding the bag.</p>              <p>To be fair, the bid by CNOOC, as the Chinese oil company is called, is considerably more complicated. But at base, lawmakers and investors should remember that despite Unocal's history -- it was founded in 1890 as the Union Oil Company of California -- it is already more Asian than ''made in America.'' About 73 percent of its proven natural-gas reserves are in Asia. And if CNOOC acquired Unocal, it ''would not increase energy flows to the Chinese market, because most of Unocal's upstream assets are locked up by long-term contracts to supply other regional markets,'' according to Jason Kindopp, an analyst at the Eurasia Group.</p>              <p>And then there is the even more basic argument about capitalism. ''U.S. oil companies need to play on an equal playing field around the world,'' said Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. ''The prospects of that happening are diminished if the U.S. government interferes in a deal like this,'' he said.</p>              <p>Mr. Kindopp makes the point even stronger, with a slight twist: ''The main long-term risk is if the economic nationalism driving Beijing's quest for energy becomes the norm, compelling Washington, Tokyo, New Dehli and others to adopt an equally strategic view of energy security.''</p>              <p>But in the end, the Washington brow-furrowers probably won't need that Botox anyway: Chevron, not CNOOC, is likely to win Unocal.</p>              <p>Chevron, whose earlier $16.4 billion bid for Unocal was topped by CNOOC, is likely to prevail with that lower bid. Investors, you see, are likely to side with Chevron, not because they are xenophobic but because they most certainly hate political uncertainty.</p>              <p>DealBook covers the news of deals daily by e-mail.

Outside China, few have. That may change someday, but in the meantime, some Chinese companies are taking a shortcut and adopting widely known names to make their presence felt abroad.</p>              <p>China's leaders have been quietly encouraging Chinese companies for years to set up overseas operations, acquire foreign assets and transform themselves into multinational corporations -- in other words, to make themselves more competitive in a world increasingly dominated by Wal-Mart, Microsoft and Coca-Cola.</p>              <p>Now, it seems, Chinese companies have gotten the message. This year, Lenovo -- the Chinese computer maker -- acquired I.B.M.'s personal computer business. Haier, one of China's biggest companies, made a bid last week for the Maytag Corporation. And in the same week, in the biggest move of all, one of China's state-owned oil giants made a hostile $18.5 billion bid for the Unocal Corporation, one of the world's largest oil companies.</p>              <p>Yet many of the companies seem to be acting partly out of desperation, as more foreign brands line the shelves of retailers in China.</p>              <p>''Chinese companies are now facing serious foreign competition at home,'' said Marshall W. Meyers, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ''So they have to do something. They've got to grow to global scale.''</p>              <p>The fact is, despite restrictions on foreign competition here, few powerful brands have emerged in China over the last two decades. And now that some of those restrictions are being lifted as part of China's ascension into the World Trade Organization, some of China's biggest companies are being forced to adopt global strategies.</p>              <p>With its I.B.M. computer purchase, Lenovo, a major Chinese computer maker but virtually unknown outside of China, is suddenly the world's third-largest computer maker after Dell and Hewlett-Packard.</p>              <p>TCL, another Chinese company, became the world's biggest television set maker last year after it acquired the television set business of Thomson of France, which also owned the old RCA brand.</p>              <p>And then there was the bid last week by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation for Unocal, an offer that touched off a Wall Street-style takeover battle with the American oil company Chevron.</p>              <p>Experts say that whether these deals succeed or not, they are symbolic of China's rapid economic rise, and its global ambitions.</p>              <p>''The Chinese government has been preparing the top 100 to 150 companies to go overseas and expand,'' said Jack J.T. Huang, a chairman of the China practice at the law firm of Jones Day. ''The government wants to use this as a testing ground, to see how well the companies stand up to international competition.''</p>              <p>Dozens of Chinese companies stand in waiting, and are not shy about their global ambitions.</p>              <p>''The future goal of the company is to make the name Great Wall known across the world,'' said Liu Rengang, a spokesman for the state-controlled Great Wall Computer Group.</p>              <p>A spokesman for Ningbo Bird, a big cellphone maker, sounded equally ambitious: ''Our future goal is to become one of the top three cellphone manufacturers in the world.''</p>              <p>Earlier this month, the Ministry of Commerce issued a report that said that even though China's exports were dominated by consumer products, there were few famous Chinese brands involved in the export trade. Most goods are being shipped abroad with foreign brand labels.</p>              <p>To rectify the situation, the ministry called on Chinese companies to start exporting their own ''famous brands.'' Every region was ordered to produce its own famous brands.</p>              <p>''We need to cultivate a group of independent famous brands that have international influence,'' the report stated. ''Each industry needs to have its own famous brand for export.''</p>              <p>The memo reads like a Communist Party document from a state planning commission. But the thinking behind the effort seems to be simple: imitate the foreigners.</p>              <p>Japanese and Korean companies like Toyota, Sony and Samsung made the moves from national to global brands successfully. But it took years.</p>              <p>Analysts say Chinese companies do not have that luxury because the rapid pace of globalization means that markets are now quickly won and lost.</p>              <p>''Chinese companies don't have that much choice but to acquire overseas companies,'' said Joe Chang, a China specialist at McKinsey &amp; Company. ''Very few companies can build organically any more. If they wait 10 to 15 years, they could be dead.''</p>              <p>By acquiring well-known brand names, experts say, Chinese companies are hoping to get access to global distribution networks, sophisticated research and development and recognizable brand names.</p>              <p>''What these companies are looking for is to build up capabilities,'' said Oded Shenkar, a professor of management at Ohio State University and author of ''The Chinese Century.'' ''This is a shortcut. They don't have billions of dollars to invest in the growth. But here in one fell swoop, you're acquiring a venerable brand name.''</p>              <p>One advantage some Chinese companies have is that they have worked for years as joint venture partners or suppliers for some of the world's biggest corporations, giving the Chinese an eye into the process of making premium-priced products.</p>              <p>And the amount of manufacturing done in China is astounding. According to C.L.S.A., an investment bank, 80 percent of the world's clocks and watches, 50 percent of its cameras, 30 percent of its microwave ovens, a quarter of its washing machines, and a fifth of the world's refrigerators are now ''Made in China.''</p>              <p>''Japanese and Korean companies initially came to the U.S. with a low-end product image,'' said Douglas Beal, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group. ''It took a long time to take Japanese brand names and turn them into high-end products. Sony now commands a premium because it's Sony. But 20 years ago they couldn't do that.''</p>              <p>The hurdles, however, are steep. The most serious problem facing Chinese companies, analysts say, is a lack of international experience and weak marketing and management structures.</p>              <p>That, experts say, is precisely why some big Chinese companies are bidding for Western icons like I.B.M., Maytag, RCA and even MG Rover, the English carmaker that has been pursued by at least three Chinese automakers in the last year.</p>              <p>And this is why after acquiring I.B.M.'s personal computer business this year, Lenovo asked the I.B.M. managers to stay on and run the entire company from New York.</p>              <p>''The most valuable asset we have acquired through I.B.M.'s PC business is its world-class management team and their extensive international experience,'' Liu Chuanzhi, the chairman of Lenovo said in an interview last December.</p>              <p>But can Lenovo run I.B.M.'s PC business? Can Haier, the appliance giant, manage Maytag?</p>              <p>Analysts are skeptical because, they say, most mergers fail.</p>              <p>''It's very difficult to make overseas acquisitions,'' said Gavin Geminder, a partner at KPMG, the global advisory firm. ''Chinese companies have the same issues, and they probably have less-qualified management teams.''</p>              <p>Chan Chun, a professor of finance at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, said Chinese companies had also struggled to manage their finances in a corporate environment.</p>              <p>''In terms of managing for shareholder value, they are weak,'' he said. ''They lack international experience and have poor financial controls.''</p>              <p>But no one expects that to slow China deal making. In fact, largely unnoticed earlier this month was a $1.4 billion bid by China Mobile, one of the giant state-owned telecom companies, for control of a Pakistani telecom company. China Mobile lost out on the deal, but its bid is notable.</p>              <p>And many of the Chinese companies are sparing no expense to hire Western lawyers and advisers.</p>              <p>Lenovo used McKinsey and Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges. Haier is teaming up with the Blackstone Group and Bain Capital to acquire Maytag. And Cnooc has hired Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom and a team of lobbyists to make its pitch for Unocal.</p>              <p>The Chinese companies are also backed by state-owned banks, private equity funds and company war chests.</p>              <p>Cnooc's bid for Unocal, for instance, is backed by a $6 billion loan from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the largest Chinese state-owned bank, and another $7 billion in loans is coming from its parent company at rates considerably below what market financing costs.</p>              <p>''There's probably a lot more deals to come,'' said Robert Morse, the chief executive for Citigroup corporate and investment banking in Asia. ''Liquidity is at an all-time high for Chinese companies looking to fund overseas acquisitions.''</p>              <p>And being the world's low-cost factory floor is no longer the country's singular ambition, analysts say.</p>              <p>That is perhaps why China Entrepreneur Magazine recently devoted a cover story to the question, ''Should China Buy Wal-Mart?''</p>              <p>Xiang Bing, the dean of the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing, wrote that if Chinese investors could pool their resources, they could acquire a controlling stake in the ultimate global retail brand: Wal-Mart Stores.</p>              <p>That, he surmised, was one way a country with few global brands but lots of goods could move up the value chain.</p>              <div><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""39""/><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""Photograph""/><div class=""mstar_entity_caption""><p> Workers unloaded some Chinese-made Haier air-conditioners at a Target Corporation promotional event in New York last year.

CNOOC said its offer represents a premium of about $1.5 billion over the value of Unocal's deal with Chevron after a $500 million breakup fee.</p>              <p>Moreover, the effort is likely to provoke a fierce debate in Washington about the nation's trade policies with China and the role of the two governments in the growing trend of deal making between companies in the countries.</p>              <p>This week, a consortium of investors led by the Haier Group, one of China's biggest companies, moved to acquire the Maytag Corporation, the American appliance maker, for about $1.3 billion, surpassing a bid from a group of American investors.</p>              <p>Last month, Lenovo, China's largest computer maker, completed its $1.75 billion deal for I.B.M.'s personal computer business, creating the world's third-largest computer maker after Dell and Hewlett-Packard.</p>              <p>After years of attracting billions in foreign investment and virtually turning itself into the world's largest factory floor, China appears to be nurturing the growth of its own corporate giants into beacons of capitalism. China wants to be a player on the world stage, and it is eager to have its own energy resources, its own multinational corporations and its own dazzling corporate names.</p>              <p>And some of China's biggest companies are now on the hunt, trying to snap up global treasures.</p>              <p>''If there's an asset up for sale anywhere in the world, people are looking to China, particularly if there's a manufacturing element involved,'' said Colin Banfield, who runs the mergers and acquisitions practice at Credit Suisse First Boston in Asia. ''And if these two deals go through this year, no one is going to doubt the credibility of the Chinese corporates when it comes to M&amp;A.''</p>              <p>The deal making and bidding wars are all the more remarkable because they involve Chinese companies taking on American multinationals in a series of transactions certain to be a boon for Western lawyers and investment bankers, many of whom have been betting hundreds of millions of dollars on China's rise.</p>              <p>Indeed, CNOOC is being advised by an army of bankers from Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase and NM Rothschild &amp; Sons of Britain.</p>              <p>In a response, Unocal said in a statement that its board would evaluate the offer, but that its recommendation of the deal with Chevron ''remains in effect.''</p>              <p>CNOOC's bid faces an uphill battle, with hurdles that probably rise above those usually confronting a corporate bidder. Already, lawmakers in Washington are questioning whether the Bush administration should intervene to block the bid for Unocal, which was founded in 1890 as the Union Oil Company of California.</p>              <p>Two Republican representatives from California, Richard W. Pombo and Duncan Hunter, wrote a letter last week to President Bush, after speculation concerning the deal arose, urging that the transaction be scrutinized on the grounds of national security.</p>              <p>They wrote: ''As the world energy landscape shifts, we believe that it is critical to understand the implications for American interests and most especially, the threat posed by China's governmental pursuit of world energy resources. The United States increasingly needs to view meeting its energy requirements within the context of our foreign policy, national security and economic security agenda.''</p>              <p>Energy Secretary Samuel W. Bodman said at a meeting of the National Petroleum Council late Wednesday that the government's review of the deal would be ''truly a complex matter,'' according to Reuters.</p>              <p>In Beijing, Liu Jianchao, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, told reporters on Tuesday that ''this is a corporate issue,'' according to Bloomberg News. ''I can't comment on this individual case,'' Mr. Liu said, ''but I can say we encourage the U.S. to allow normal trade relations to take place without political interference.''</p>              <p>TCL, a Chinese company that began by making cassette tapes in 1981, is suddenly the world's biggest television set maker, after its acquisition last July of the television business of Thomson of France, which owned the old RCA brand.</p>              <p>Chinese companies still have a long way to go to become global giants that can compete head-to-head with Toyota, Siemens or General Electric. Most of the China deals are small in value -- about $1 billion to $2 billion -- when compared with big American or European deals.</p>              <p>Whether CNOOC's bid will succeed on it merits is unclear. It is interested in Unocal, once known for its 76 brand, less for its exploration and production in North America than for its huge reserves in Asia. Twenty-seven percent of Unocal's proven oil reserves and 73 percent of its proven natural gas reserves are in Asia, according to Merrill Lynch.</p>              <p>To succeed, CNOOC will have to persuade Unocal's shareholders to vote against their deal with Chevron. The new deal would then face a shareholder vote.</p>              <p>Even though CNOOC's offer is worth $1.5 billion more than Chevron's, some shareholders could still decide that the regulatory review process and the time required to complete a deal with CNOOC would pose too great a risk, given the size of the offer.</p>              <p>Chevron, which could raise its bid to counter CNOOC, is racing to complete its deal and submit it to a shareholder vote as early as August. The company made no specific comment on the Chinese offer.</p>              <p>CNOOC's all-cash offer values Unocal at $67 a share. Chevron's cash and stock offer values Unocal at $61.26 a share, based on Chevron's closing price on Wednesday of $58.27 a share.

"321","2005-07-24","Who's Afraid of China Inc.?","433104798","New York Times","3.1","            >                                        >                          <p>WILLIAM A. REINSCH, an avowed free trader, welcomes China's rising stature in the international economy. After all, he is the president of the National Foreign Trade Council, an organization founded in 1914 to promote an ''open world trading system.'' Indeed, when he was a senior trade official in the Clinton administration, Mr. Reinsch was chided by some security analysts who said he was being soft on China by placing matters of commerce ahead of national security.</p>              <p>But even Mr. Reinsch is uneasy about China's attempt to buy Unocal, a midsize American oil company. The outcome of the takeover contest for Unocal is uncertain, and last week its board embraced an improved offer from Chevron. Yet Cnooc, a government-backed Chinese oil company, still has the higher offer -- and it could up the ante.</p>              <p>If the Chinese bid proceeds, Mr. Reinsch wants to see a thorough national security review of the deal, one that goes beyond the usual focus on weapons technology to include energy security. ''Our Army, Navy and Air Force run on oil,'' he explained.</p>              <p>Oil is the ultimate geopolitical commodity -- it is ''The Prize,'' as Daniel Yergin titled his epic history of petroleum and international politics. And even if Cnooc fails to grab Unocal, the pursuit has pushed the two sides of the Chinese challenge together and into the spotlight of public debate. For China is both an engine of economic globalization and an emerging military power. In symbolic shorthand, it is Wal-Mart with an army.</p>              <p>The two sides aren't neatly divided. But those who focus on economics tend to see partnership, cooperation and reasons for optimism despite tensions, while security experts are more pessimistic and anticipate strategic conflict as the likely future for two political systems that are so different.</p>              <p>In China, there are also two camps -- the security hawks and the economic modernists, according to China analysts. The modernists see China joining the United States as the second great economic power of the 21st century, and the two nations sharing the gains from increased trade ties and global growth. The hawks regard that view as naive, and fret that American policy is to remain the world's only superpower and to curb China's rise. So China's response, the hawks say, is to try to erode United States hegemony and reduce America's power to hold China down.</p>              <p>Both faces of China have been evident recently. Two weeks ago, a senior Chinese military official, Maj. Gen. Zhu Chenghu, said China should use nuclear weapons against the United States if the American military intervenes in any conflict over Taiwan. Then, bowing to pressure from the United States and other trading partners, China announced last Thursday that it would no longer peg its currency tightly to the dollar. It is a measured step, and it will not do much to moderate China's huge trade surplus with the United States anytime soon. But the move is a sign of flexibility and accommodation.</p>              <p>''Do we see each other inevitably as antagonists, or do we see a world of globalization from which both sides benefit? That is the big issue,'' said Kenneth Lieberthal, a senior official in the National Security Council during the Clinton administration.</p>              <p>''And that framework, one way or another,'' added Mr. Lieberthal, a China analyst and a professor at the University of Michigan business school, ''will drive an enormous number of policy decisions.''</p>              <p>So that is the China question: Is it an opportunity or a threat? If nothing else, the Cnooc bid for Unocal has shown how unsettled American thinking is on China and how deep the anxieties run, both in matters of national security and trade.</p>              <p>It is easy to dismiss Washington as a hot-air factory, but the scope of the outcry in Congress is significant. Resolutions and legislative proposals, all critical of Cnooc's takeover bid, have piled up in the House and Senate, from Republicans and Democrats. A resolution presented last month by Representative Richard W. Pombo, a California Republican, declared that permitting the Chinese company to buy Unocal would ''threaten to impair the national security of the United States.'' It passed, 398 to 15.</p>              <p>Senator Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat, has drafted three pieces of anti-Cnooc legislation that range from calling for a six-month Congressional inquiry into the bid to a bill that would prohibit the deal. Mr. Dorgan objects to the Chinese move on fair-trade grounds. The Chinese government, he says, would not allow an American company to buy a Chinese oil company. ''So why on earth should they be able to buy an American oil company?'' Mr. Dorgan said.</p>              <p>Yet the Chinese takeover bid taps into a deeper concern about trade and globalization for Mr. Dorgan. He talks of manufacturing jobs lost to China, intellectual-property pirates in China illegally copying American movies and software, and a trade deficit with China that is rising astronomically with no end in sight. ''Trade should be mutually beneficial, and it is certainly not with China,'' Mr. Dorgan said.</p>              <p>The tempest in Congress has increased the political risks surrounding the Cnooc bid. At $18.5 billion, the bid remains higher than Chevron's sweetened offer of $17 billion. But Wall Street analysts say Cnooc will have to go higher to have a chance to win, offering a sizable premium over the Chevron bid to compensate for delays of a government review of the Chinese offer or even the possibility that Washington may block a Chinese deal.</p>              <p>It would be an extreme step, but Congress has the power to ''regulate commerce with foreign nations,'' under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. ''My sense is that Congress is not going to stand still for a Cnooc takeover being approved,'' said C. Richard D'Amato, chairman of the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, an advisory group to Congress. ''That is the political reality.''</p>              <p>Cnooc and its advisers misread the political environment in Washington. Fu Chengyu, the Cnooc chairman who earned a graduate degree from the University of Southern California, has said he was surprised by the intensity of political criticism. Cnooc's path would have been smoother if it had joined with an American oil company as a partner in its bid, an option that was considered briefly but rejected, according to a person close to the company.</p>              <p>The idea, the person said, would have been that the American company would acquire Unocal's assets in the United States, while Cnooc took the main prize in the deal -- Unocal's offshore natural gas fields in Asia and its expertise in offshore exploration and production. The gas reserves and skill are considered strategic to China's goal of moving away from coal and generating 20 percent of the nation's electricity from natural gas by 2020. ''It would have been better to have not made this big move a head-on attack, to have linked up with an American partner so the deal would have been less threatening and less a lightning rod for China politics in the United States,'' the person said.</p>              <p>Perhaps, but many economists and trade specialists contend that the American angst over the Cnooc bid says more about the United States than it does about China or Cnooc's tactics. ''All this really points to the anxieties about globalization in our own society,'' said Clyde V. Prestowitz, a trade official in the Reagan administration and president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington. ''We are so economically interdependent with China now and we chose that path.'' </p>              <p>Washington pushed for China's integration into the international economy and its entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001. American companies have farmed out much of their manufacturing to Chinese factories. American consumers have been on a Chinese shopping spree for years, buying everything from clothes to computers made there. That is why the United States had a record $162 billion trade deficit with China last year. China sits on $700 billion in foreign exchange reserves, mostly in dollars. It recycles those funds in good part by investing in United States Treasury bonds; that keeps American interest rates low, fueling the real estate boom.</p>              <p>''We handed China the money they are using to try to buy Unocal,'' said Mr. Prestowitz, author of a new book on the shift of wealth and power to Asia, ''Three Billion New Capitalists'' (Basic Books, 2005). ''And now we're telling the Chinese, please keep investing in our bonds but you can't invest what amounts to a sliver of their surplus in an oil company. That's really confused and hypocritical on our part.''</p>              <p>Where others see muddle, R. James Woolsey, director of the Central Intelligence Agency in the Clinton administration, sees strategic clarity in challenging the Cnooc bid. Oil is a globally traded commodity, Mr. Woolsey concedes, but it is also a strategic resource in a market that is tightening because of rising demand from fast-growing nations like China and India. That, Mr. Woolsey says, is before one begins thinking of the possible impact of, say, an act of terrorist sabotage in a crucial Middle East oil field.</p>              <p>''China is realistically assuming there may be a shortage of oil,'' said Mr. Woolsey, a vice president in the Booz Allen Hamilton consulting firm.</p>              <p>In China, Mr. Woolsey sees a nation with military ambitions to challenge the United States, and a political system with little regard for human rights and free speech. Cnooc, in Mr. Woolsey's view, is the corporate vehicle of ''a Communist dictatorship.''</p>              <p>The Cnooc move, according to Frank Gaffney Jr., a senior Defense Department official in the Reagan administration, is a step to ensure that China has the resources for its overarching national design. ''China's strategy is to supplant the United States as the premier economic power in the world and, should it become necessary, defeat us militarily,'' said Mr. Gaffney, president of the Center for Security Policy.</p>              <p>The strategic concern was much narrower at William Blair &amp; Company. Until recently, William Blair, the investment firm in Chicago, was the largest outside shareholder in Cnooc, which is majority-owned by the Chinese government. But William Blair sold off its stake, worth about $160 million, in recent weeks because of worries that Cnooc was behaving too much like a state-owned company and not enough like a capitalist enterprise trying to maximize returns to shareholders, explained David Merjan, a fund manager at the firm.</p>              <p>The pricey bid for Unocal, Mr. Merjan said, raised doubts about how independent Cnooc really was from the Chinese government. ''If China is going to sell shares in a company like Cnooc to outside shareholders, it should not be run for the benefit of Chinese economic policy,'' Mr. Merjan said.</p>              <p>CNOOC and its pursuit of Unocal, it seems, are part of China's evolutionary path. Cnooc is playing its hand with plenty of government help, about $7 billion in loans on terms Western oil companies could not hope to get. Accordingly, Cnooc may be willing and able to overpay. Yes, China is hunting for oil and gas assets around the world as a national priority. Still, that is happening in a nation that is drifting steadily toward a market economy, though one with more central control than Americans view as a free-market economy.</p>              <p>The Chinese Communist Party, with 60 million members -- more than the population of France -- does guide the economy, if less and less over time. ''But think of it as the Chinese bureaucratic capitalist party,'' said Mr. Lieberthal of the University of Michigan. ''It has nothing really to do with Communism.''</p>              <p>Mr. Lieberthal counts himself as among the optimists on China. Globalization, he says, and continued integration of the Chinese and American economies can work to mutual benefit. The spread of middle-class affluence and education across more of the Chinese population should eventually be a force for democratic liberalization, following the pattern of Taiwan and South Korea.</p>              <p>''Am I a hundred percent sure I'm right? No, but that's the long-term bet I'd make,'' Mr. Lieberthal said. ''And if you let the pessimists -- the people who believe that the U.S. and China will inevitably be enemies -- drive policy, then the outcome will be the one they predict.''</p>              <div><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""39""/><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""Photograph""/><div class=""mstar_entity_caption""><p> China's offer to acquire Unocal has touched off intense debates on trade, globalization and military might.

Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.</p></div></object></div>              <p>LATELY there has been much grandstanding about the dangers of the bid by a government-backed Chinese oil company, Cnooc, for Unocal. But protectionists are focusing on the wrong target. It's true that China could be a threat to American energy security some day, but not because it wants to buy an American company already on the block.</p>              <p>Before American politicians intervene to make sure that Unocal's Indonesian gas and oil fields remain in the hands of a United States corporation, they would do well to recall some history. In the 1930's, the Japanese government, urged on by the Japanese military and domestic oil firms, began asserting control over oil imports, refining facilities and oil resources in its colonies in China to the detriment of the Western companies, which, at the time, owned the majority of Japan's oil business. The Japanese government considered this a vital move to protect the country's security. But American and European oil companies protested. In August 1934, Walter Teagle of Standard Oil and Henri Deterding of Royal Dutch Shell lobbied Washington to frighten Japan into moderation by hinting at a cutoff of American oil exports. The State Department demurred, but mutual tension over oil supplies escalated into paranoia and contributed to the build-up to World War II.</p>              <p>The outcry over China's potential acquisition of Unocal may or may not partake of the same kind of historical dynamic. But in reality, China's purchase of Unocal's Indonesian assets is hardly a threat that merits the rise in bilateral tensions and political gamesmanship that could follow an American effort to block the Cnooc deal.</p>              <p>In fact, even if the Chinese acquired Unocal -- which seems less likely now that a rival bidder, Chevron, has sweetened its offer -- Cnooc's oil output would still be a small fraction of that of top American companies.</p>              <p>Chevron, for example, produced more than 1.8 million barrels a day in 2004 from reserves holding close to 8,599 million barrels. Cnooc barely produces a tenth of that from its overseas holdings. The top three American firms -- ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips -- together produced about 5.6 million barrels a day last year. It is hard to imagine how China's purchase of Unocal's limited oil assets would threaten such powerful American companies or the United States itself.</p>              <p>Moreover, it is in the American interest to promote open access to foreign investment in oil exploration and production. Without it, American oil companies could not survive, and the prospects for diversity in the oil supply, a notion the United States has long favored, would be considerably dimmed. If anything, the United States should be pushing policies that expand such access in oil-rich countries like Iraq, Mexico, Russia and Saudi Arabia.</p>              <p>That said, there is real reason for American concern about China's suddenly voracious oil thirst. Right now, that thirst translates into a willingness to overbid for assets like Unocal. But to what strategies might China turn if Western competitors prevent it from acquiring choice assets?</p>              <p>Already, China has secured some very attractive oil acreage in countries with which the United States has had troubled relations -- notably Iran, Sudan and, more recently, Venezuela. In some cases, the Chinese have purposely gone this route to take advantage of American sanctions policies. In doing so, they've helped to undermine the effectiveness of American efforts to isolate these nations, and they've given such countries the impression that so long as they have oil, they can fruitfully play China and the United States against each other.</p>              <p>From economic ties, political and military relationships often follow, and these pose even more fundamental risks to American security. China has begun expanding its light arms trade in many of the countries that supply it with oil. In Sudan, China has had to deploy quasi-military personnel to protect its oil facilities from local insurgents. And Beijing initially took a nonconstructive position on the crisis in Darfur, mainly because it couldn't afford to alienate the Sudanese government, since the China National Petroleum Corporation has a big presence in Sudan's prolific Heglig field.</p>              <p>As China's energy requirements expand, Beijing's tactics could become more assertive, even aggressive. It is certainly not in our interest for China, a nuclear power, to be increasingly susceptible to political pressure from oil-producing states, or for it to lock out other consuming nations from sources of energy. China and Japan have nearly come to blows over a gas field in the East China Sea, and that is just a reminder of what can go wrong.</p>              <p>The United States won't enhance its security by threatening to obstruct China's Unocal purchase. Instead, American policymakers should explore the possibility of a constructive, high-level dialogue with China on energy and the Middle East. The United States Department of Energy runs an alternative energy research program with Beijing that could serve as a good example of how to nurture common interests. We would also be wise to bring China into the oil emergency stockpiling system in coordination with the International Energy Agency, because reducing the risks to China's supply is a winning strategy for us, too.</p>              <p>For now, the United States can afford to take the high road. China won't be a serious economic rival for years to come. And maybe by that time, its political stance will have changed on key issues like North Korea, Iran, intellectual property and, most important, human rights.</p>              <p>In the meantime, we should not forget that if it wanted to, the United States Navy could block China's access to Cnooc's foreign oil any day of the week. China, however, would have difficulty imposing such a blockade on American companies. It's true that as an oil importer, China is on the rise. But who here is really a threat to whom? The United States should take a step back and see the Unocal bid for what it is -- a move to be settled by the market.</p>                      "
"323","2005-07-13","Unocal Bid Opens Up New Issues Of Security","433115939","New York Times","C.1","            >                                        >                          <p>The fate of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation's bid for Unocal remains uncertain, but one thing is clear. The takeover offer has prompted a gathering groundswell in Congress to make sure oil is defined as a product vital to America's national security.</p>              <p>If the political push gains momentum, it will change the mandate and reach of a little-known, secretive body with representatives from 12 government agencies, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The outcome of Cnooc's bid for Unocal may rest in the hands of that committee.</p>              <p>One salvo came at the end of last month with a House resolution that declared that permitting the Chinese company to buy Unocal would ''threaten to impair the national security of the United States.'' It passed 398 to 15.</p>              <p>Now the members of a bipartisan advisory group to Congress are urging representatives and senators to amend the law that controls the work of the foreign investment committee. The Congressional advisory group wants the law to specifically expand the definition of America's national security to include matters of economic security, like energy and oil supplies.</p>              <p>''Is energy security national security? We certainly think it is,'' said C. Richard D'Amato, chairman of the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which advises Congress.</p>              <p>Mr. D'Amato is scheduled to testify today at a House Armed Services Committee hearing on the national security implications of the Chinese company's pending bid for Unocal, a midsize American oil company.</p>              <p>The $18.5 billion bid by Cnooc competes with one from Chevron, which is lower at $16.8 billion. But the Chevron offer came before the Cnooc bid surfaced, and Cnooc faces regulatory and political hurdles that Chevron does not. The Unocal board has approved the Chevron offer, but is now talking with Cnooc as well.</p>              <p>To treat oil, a globally traded commodity, as a national security product would represent a departure for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as Cfius (pronounced SIH-fee-us), created in 1988 to scrutinize foreign purchases of American companies for national security concerns. The committee, headed by the Treasury secretary, has representatives from 12 agencies including the State Department, Defense Department, Department of Homeland Security, Commerce Department, Office of the United States Trade Representative and National Security Council. Its proceedings are secret.</p>              <p>Over the years, in both Republican and Democratic administrations, the investment committee has typically focused on the potential of a foreign takeover to transfer military-related technologies used in arms like fighter jets, precision bombs and nuclear submarines.</p>              <p>The committee, according to foreign trade specialists and former government officials, routinely looks for so-called dual-use technologies that have advanced industrial and military applications. To satisfy those security concerns, mergers have often been modified -- to spin off a small but sensitive operation, for example, or restrict access to a plant to American employees. In some cases, bidders drop their offers when confronted with the committee review and its conditions.</p>              <p>Of more than 1,500 filings to the committee in 17 years, only about a dozen cases, trade experts say, have gone through a 30-day preliminary inquiry and a 45-day investigation, and then been referred to the president with a recommendation to approve or block the deal. Only one deal has been blocked on national security grounds: the 1990 sale of a airplane parts maker based in Seattle, Mamco Manufacturing, to the China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation.</p>              <p>A Cnooc-Unocal deal, trade and security analysts say, could raise some traditional national security concerns that the investment committee would want to investigate. For example, the analysts said that Unocal had underwater terrain-mapping technology used for offshore oil exploration that might also be useful in navigation for the Chinese military's growing fleet of submarines.</p>              <p>''There could be national security issues in the Cnooc deal, but locking up oil is not one of them,'' said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a former senior official on the National Security Council in the Clinton administration, who is a China expert at the University of Michigan.</p>              <p>Many economists and oil specialists are skeptical that owning oil is vital to national security. Controlling the oil and gas reserves in the ground, they say, does not increase a nation's energy security as long as there is a deep worldwide market for buying it by the barrel or tanker.</p>              <p>But the national security concern raised by members of Congress, their advisers and some oil experts is that the petroleum market may be changing because of tight supplies, rapidly rising demand from fast-growing nations like China and India, and the increasing strategy among state-owned oil companies to control reserves.</p>              <p>As a result, they warn, less oil will be bought and sold on the free market, while more will be locked up by national interests.</p>              <p>''I'm generally a free-trader, but I do think that we need to understand our security differently,'' explained Larry M. Wortzel, a former military attache to the American Embassy in Beijing and a member of the Congressional United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission.</p>              <p>Another member of the Congressional commission, Michael R. Wessel, said: ''I think most people would agree that oil is a national security issue. What is still to be determined, of course, is what to do about it.''</p>              <p>That would be a politically difficult call, if the Bush administration had to make one in the Cnooc case. Both the Chinese company and its critics in Congress have asked the foreign investment committee to review the Cnooc bid. The Chinese company made its lengthy voluntary filing to the committee on June 29.</p>              <p>''Everybody in Congress was calling for a national security review,'' observed Daniel L. Spiegel, a partner in the law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld, which represents Cnooc. ''We heard the calls and we moved forward. We made the filing.'' </p>              <p>The Cnooc side has heard nothing yet from the investment committee, which has apparently not begun a review. Cnooc contends that delay favors Chevron, and its own bid is hardly ''hypothetical,'' as Treasury Secretary John W. Snow termed the Cnooc offer.</p>              <p>The Treasury Department position is that an inquiry will not start until ''the committee has made a determination that a transaction is likely to be successful,'' said Tony Fratto, a department spokesman.</p>              <p>In the past, the foreign investment committee has conducted reviews of unsolicited takeover bids. It did so in 1990 when BTR of Britain bid for Norton, a producer of industrial abrasives whose products were used to make aircraft parts and missile domes. Later, when Saint-Gobain of France joined the contest, the foreign investment committee conducted the two reviews simultaneously. Saint-Gobain eventually won with a higher bid, and President George H.W. Bush approved the sale.</p>              <p>The administration, foreign policy specialists say, wants to put off a decision on Cnooc if it can. The United States, they note, faces a series of thorny issues with China on other fronts. Washington wants Beijing to put pressure on North Korea in coming nuclear disarmament talks; the United States is pressing China to restrain its digital pirates, who illegally copy movies, software and other goods; and there are the continuing tensions over China's huge trade surplus with the United States, manufacturing jobs lost to China and Washington's call for China to loosen its fixed-rate currency policy.</p>              <p>''The Bush administration would rather see the Cnooc bid and the issues surrounding it just go away somehow,'' said Mr. Lieberthal of the University of Michigan.

"324","2005-07-09","China Oil Giants Crave Respectability and Power","433123174","New York Times","C.1","            >                                        >                          <p>Two years ago, the China National Offshore Oil   Corporation and another Chinese state-controlled oil company seemed on the verge of capturing a large patch of foreign oil reserves with a handshake deal to pay $1.23 billion for part of a field in Kazakhstan.</p>              <p>But the prospect was snatched away two months later when the Western companies operating the oil field asserted their legal right to buy the stake instead. For the Chinese oil executives, it was a rude defeat that emphasized their marginal status on the global energy map.</p>              <p>Indeed, for all their efforts over the last dozen years, Chinese companies have remarkably little to show for it -- just a string of largely second-rate, remote, dubious or uncertain energy investments for which they have mostly overpaid.</p>              <p>Cnooc's leaders are determined not to be upstaged again. And with their $18.5 billion bid for the American oil company Unocal last month, Cnooc is wagering significantly more in one stroke than Chinese energy concerns have spent so far globally.</p>              <p>Turning from the steppes of Kazakhstan to the freeways of Southern California, Cnooc is endeavoring to help transform China from a marginal player in the energy markets to a powerful force in a better position to tap the world's natural resources. And in doing so, some experts say, it is ready to pay a higher price for energy assets -- a China premium, as some call it -- to raise the chances of closing a deal.</p>              <p>Cnooc's surprise offer comes at a time of concern in Washington about Chinese influence over the American economy and amid heightened fears about the nation's energy security. It has prompted suspicion and hostility from many members of Congress.</p>              <p>But viewed from China, Cnooc's thrust at Unocal only underlines the extent to which China's top three oil companies -- PetroChina; China Petroleum and Chemical, also known as Sinopec; and Cnooc -- are earnestly seeking to expand their reach.</p>              <p>Their eclectic collection spans 44 countries, including pariah states like Sudan and Myanmar -- a grab bag of holdings that would strain the management of even the biggest multinationals.</p>              <p>''They're not picking up the best stuff -- they're picking up stuff in the middle and, in some cases, the dregs,'' said Philip Andrews-Speed, the director of the Center for Energy, Petroleum and Mineral Law and Policy at the University of Dundee in Scotland.</p>              <p>Total commitments by the three companies have reached only $15 billion over the last decade to build equity stakes in oil and gas fields outside China, according to the James A. Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.</p>              <p>The Chinese oil giants are belatedly following a well-trodden path -- one that France, Italy and Britain have taken -- to build national players that can secure access to the globe's energy resources. But the Chinese companies have had the misfortune of trying to build overseas empires at a time of steeply rising prices and renewed nationalism among the governments of oil-producing nations. Their combined overseas reserves remain a tenth of the reserves of a single big Western multinational like BP.</p>              <p>Cnooc, with 93 percent of its reserves in China, is the exact opposite in globalization from BP, with 93 percent of its proven reserves outside of Britain. PetroChina, the giant of China's oil industry, will still have 95 percent of its reserves in China even after the consolidation of a wide range of overseas holdings being transferred by its parent, the China National Petroleum Corporation, or C.N.P.C.</p>              <p>Sinopec, mainly a refiner, has barely begun to acquire overseas assets. But C.N.P.C. and Sinopec have been active in acquiring exploration rights from Mauritania and Angola to Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan so overseas reserves could rise sharply in the coming years if the companies strike oil.</p>              <p>The PIRA Energy Group, a New York-based oil consultancy, estimates that China's top three companies now control 300,000 to 400,000 barrels of oil production a day outside of China, or 10 percent of their domestic production. Unocal would add a daily oil production of 170,000 barrels a day and the equivalent of 260,000 barrels a day of natural gas.</p>              <p>By comparison, crude production outside the United States for the three largest American oil companies amounts to 70 percent of their total output.</p>              <p>Still, Chinese oil workers are becoming a growing presence in the Middle East, Africa and South America, and their executives can now be spotted roving through remote outposts in Libya or negotiating long-term agreements in Iran or Saudi Arabia.</p>              <p>C.N.P.C. has been crucial in developing the oil resources of Sudan, a country that Western oil companies have been forced to leave because of pressure over its poor human-rights record; in Algeria, Sinopec has won exploration and drilling rights to look for new sources of oil; in Venezuela, C.N.P.C. won operating agreements in bidding rounds that included oil giants like BP or Shell.</p>              <p>China's future energy appetite is expected to be enormous. The country, a net exporter of crude oil only a dozen years ago, recently surpassed Japan as the world's second-largest oil consumer. Its domestic production amounts to 3.5 million barrels a day, slightly over half the country's daily needs of 6.7 million barrels.</p>              <p>Last year, oil demand in China grew by 16 percent. In 20 years, China is expected to consume nearly 13 million barrels a day, or 10 percent of what experts hope will be the world's total at the time -- with imports exceeding nine million barrels. And if production fails to expand fast enough, China could put even more pressure on global oil supplies.</p>              <p>Since the mid-1990's, the Chinese authorities have mandated that their oil companies expand abroad.</p>              <p>Many China experts say that the country is so eager for overseas reserves that it will inevitably be willing to pay top dollar. Also, Chinese companies have been more willing to assume that oil prices will stay high. Most Western companies base their planning for oil projects on the idea that they should be profitable when oil is roughly $25 a barrel.</p>              <p>''The Chinese take a long-term perspective to securing strategic resources rather than a short-term investment perspective,'' said Christopher H. Stephens, a senior partner at Coudert Brothers specializing in mergers and acquisitions in China who is not involved in the fight for control of Unocal. ''They don't face those pressures to show investment returns on a quarterly basis.''</p>              <p>Other experts are more blunt. ''The Chinese are blindly going ahead with what commercial sense would not advise, blindly buying up investments in rogue states,'' said Brahma Chellaney, a strategic studies professor at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi.</p>              <p>Fu Chengyu, Cnooc's chief executive, denied that Cnooc had been engaged in a scattershot effort to buy into any oil fields that came on the market. But he also defined the company's strategy in broad terms that did not exclude such an approach.</p>              <p>Cnooc, the smallest of the three Chinese oil companies, is not the only one with global ambitions. Wang Guoliang, the chief financial officer of PetroChina, the publicly traded subsidiary of C.N.P.C., signaled his company's ambitions at a news conference on June 10. He said it ''will eventually grow from a mainly domestic oil and gas company to an international corporation with significant international oil and gas assets.''</p>              <p>PetroKazakhstan, a Canadian company with substantial oil fields in Kazakhstan, one of China's western neighbors, announced last week that it had received ''approaches from a number of different parties regarding a potential corporate transaction involving either an acquisition or a merger with the company.'' Investment bankers said that PetroChina had been especially interested in PetroKazakhstan.</p>              <p>Whether Cnooc's bid for Unocal includes a geopolitical premium of some sort is particularly hard to pin down because the company owns a mixture of oil and gas assets covered by a range of contracts requiring deliveries at various prices for years to come. Based on Cnooc's experience in Kazakhstan and Angola, Unocal may present some additional benefits to Cnooc, energy experts said.</p>              <p>By buying a company outright, rather than stakes in existing oil fields, Cnooc avoids the risk of another government or company exercising the sort of pre-emption right on stakes that Cnooc and Sinopec lost out to in Kazakhstan two years ago.</p>              <p>With their willingness to make optimistic assumptions about oil prices and their ability to borrow heavily from the government, Chinese companies are likely to keep on making acquisitions regardless of what happens with Unocal.</p>              <p>''We evaluate things now on $24 oil,'' complained William Gammell, the chief executive of Cairn Energy of Scotland, ''but you can't make transactions on that any more.''</p>              <div><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""39""/><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""Photograph""/><div class=""mstar_entity_caption""><p> An oil field in Shandong Province owned by the China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation, known as Sinopec.

"325","2005-08-11","America's Summer of Discontent","433130140","New York Times","A.22","            >                                        >                          <p>Yesterday, Unocal shareholders agreed to be bought by Chevron for about $18 billion in the biggest oil acquisition in years. The deal brought to a final close a sad hostile takeover fight in which a Chinese government-owned company, Cnooc, was effectively blocked from the game by a hostile United States Congress.</p>              <p>When analysts and economic historians look back, this summer may well prove to be the turning point in Chinese-American relations, the time when America chose short-range paranoia over rational behavior. From the dozen or so proposals in Congress for across-the-board tariffs against Chinese imports to the Pentagon's rumblings about Chinese military buildups, the rhetoric from Washington keeps escalating. America seems to be on the run, fueled by the false perception that China's rapid economic rise poses an inevitable threat to the United States. By repeatedly demonizing China, Washington risks creating the hostility it fears.</p>              <p>The Chinese economic surge has been awesome. If America is going to respond to it reasonably, its leaders -- and the public -- will have to acknowledge the obvious: China is no longer a second-level economic power that can be bullied around. America's financial stability rests in no small way on the continued Chinese purchase of the government's debt. And in foreign affairs, China's concerns will have to be part of almost every calculation. Congress had the power to insert a clause in the energy bill that would make it all but impossible for the Chinese to buy Unocal. But Congress cannot stop China's thirst for oil. Its energy consumption has increased phenomenally, up 65 percent between 2002 and 2004. It is now the second-largest oil market in the world, behind the United States. Among the places it has been shopping are Iran and Sudan.</p>              <p>Those oil-market relationships have already created considerable problems for the United States. Part of the reason it was so hard for America and Britain to get the humanitarian crisis in Darfur onto the United Nations' Security Council agenda last year was because China resisted calls to pressure the Sudanese government. Similarly, any attempt to impose United Nations economic sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program now risks running into opposition from Beijing.</p>              <p>The scheduled visit of China's president, Hu Jintao, to Washington next month is a chance to put Chinese-American relations on a sounder footing. President Bush should seize the opportunity to muzzle the anti-China crowd who are putting flashy sound bites ahead of America's greater global interests.</p>                      "
"326","2005-08-03","China Retreats Now, But It Will Be Back","433147011","New York Times","C.1","            >                                        >                          <p>Just as a tactical retreat is sometimes useful in winning broader battles, as Sun Tzu wrote 2,500 years ago, the withdrawal of Cnooc Ltd.'s bid for Unocal seems unlikely to derail China Inc.'s economic expansion overseas, and may even hold a few lessons.</p>              <p>The sight of a Chinese company trying to buy a business once known for the Union 76 brand of gasoline made the proposed deal a lightning rod for American worries about everything from manufacturing job losses to high oil prices to the security of energy supplies. But while Congressional resistance appears to have torpedoed the Chinese bid, the economic fundamentals behind that bid remain in place, from China's vast foreign currency reserves to its ravenous appetite for imported oil.</p>              <p>The most immediate effect from the failed bid may be on Chinese public opinion toward the United States.</p>              <p>China's state-controlled media had devoted extensive coverage to the Cnooc bid, presenting it to the public as an exclusively commercial arrangement.</p>              <p>''This is a very symbolic deal that made Chinese people proud of themselves,'' said Jin Canrong, the associate dean of the School of International Studies at People's University. ''Definitely, they will feel some kind of disappointment.'' </p>              <p>Chinese officials face the challenge of managing carefully any potential fallout at home from the deal's collapse. It is unlikely, however, to prompt the kind of public criticism directed against Japan this spring for whitewashing sections of history textbooks describing Japanese atrocities in China during World War II.</p>              <p>One worry outside China is that the failed bid could encourage Chinese oil companies to step up investing in countries like Sudan and Myanmar, whose leaderships are in poor favor with the White House and yet are eager for any investment they can get. Chinese companies also could buy more oil and gas from Russia and Iran.</p>              <p>But Mr. Jin and other specialists said on Tuesday that in any case, Chinese policy makers were likely to react pragmatically, with no effort to dump the central government's huge holdings of American securities and with little deviation from a long-term effort to acquire foreign brands, technology and energy assets. Christopher H. Stephens, a senior partner at Coudert Brothers specializing in mergers and acquisitions in China, said that China's leadership was most likely to opt for a narrowly commercial retaliation against the United States. ''You may see a large aircraft order go to Airbus, or a large oil concession go to BP or Shell,'' he said.</p>              <p>The withdrawal of the Cnooc bid may even help less politicized deals move forward, like the agreement last Friday by Nanjing Automobile of China to buy an engine factory and other assets from the bankrupt MG Rover Group of Britain. Nanjing Automobile will box up the engine factory equipment and ship it to east-central China for use in engine production there.</p>              <p>That deal represented an important step by the auto industry of China to address one of its biggest weaknesses, the design and manufacture of reliable engines. China's ability to become an internationally competitive auto manufacturer may be more important to the country's economic success in the long run than its ability to buy oil and gas reserves overseas.</p>              <p>Many experts question whether China even needs to own more such energy assets. Japanese companies bought overseas oil fields in the 1970's only to conclude that they could more efficiently meet the country's import needs by buying on world markets.</p>              <p>William C. Ramsay, the deputy executive director of the International Energy Agency, said in an interview three weeks ago in Paris that the purchase of a large overseas oil company by a Chinese company with deep pockets might be good for global energy markets, by providing extra investment in oil fields that might otherwise be neglected. But he questioned whether bids like Cnooc's to own barrels of oil under the ground in foreign countries would increase China's energy security.</p>              <p>''It isn't necessarily about barrels but about price,'' he said.</p>              <p>Philip Andrews-Speed, an expert on China's oil industry at the University of Dundee in Scotland, said that Chinese oil companies were likely to continue the same slow, steady purchase of small oil fields that they have pursued for the last decade, while remaining on the lookout for bigger deals.</p>              <p>''You've got a range of possibilities -- they buy whole companies, they buy parts of companies, or they go asset by asset,'' he said.</p>              <p>The Chinese government still has $711 billion in foreign currency reserves that need to be invested. The reserves are mostly parked in Treasuries, American mortgage-backed securities and a mishmash of other financial instruments earning single-digit interest rates, a meager return that has become controversial within China.</p>              <p>A Cnooc deal could have provided another investment opportunity; the government announced in late spring that it would inject $15 billion into a big state-owned bank, which in turn agreed to lend $6 billion for the Cnooc bid. Mr. Jin said that the State Administration of Foreign Exchange would continue managing the country's foreign exchange reserves with an eye to maximizing the return on them.</p>              <p>Cnooc's withdrawal comes after Haier, a Chinese manufacturer of appliances and electronics, pulled out of efforts to buy heavily unionized Maytag, a bid that also faced political hurdles, although smaller ones. But a less politicized deal, Lenovo's purchase of I.B.M.'s personal computer business, went through over the winter with less controversy despite some warnings that important American technology might end up in the hands of a potentially hostile power.</p>              <p>One lesson may be that Chinese companies are likely to complete deals that do not directly antagonize any large economic interest in the United States. The Haier proposal was a potential challenge to the United Automobile Workers, one of the largest and most politically influential unions in the United States and easily the wealthiest. The Unocal bid upset Chevron, which had submitted what now appears to be the winning bid for Unocal and which lobbied Congress heavily against the Cnooc bid.</p>              <p>Mr. Stephens said that Chinese companies might show a broader wariness of investing in energy deals in the United States, because of the sector's strategic importance. Chinese companies may also become more cautious about purchases of labor-intensive companies, even including nonunion businesses, for fear of antagonizing politicians who fear that the buyer would move production home to China.</p>              <p>Cnooc has learned the hard way the importance of paying attention not just to the executive branch in Washington but also to Congress. That may be a difficult point to grasp for Communist officials raised in a country where the National People's Congress has long done little more than rubber-stamp decisions by the leadership, although this has started to change in China as well.</p>              <p>Cnooc's advisers checked with administration officials before starting the bid and encountered no strong opposition, but did not try the more arduous -- and less leakproof -- approach of sounding out a spectrum of members of Congress, a person involved with Cnooc's bid said.</p>              <p>Japanese companies responded to protectionism in the United States in the 1980's by hiring hundreds of lobbyists in Washington, including many former government officials. But Chinese companies like Cnooc have barely begun trying to influence the American political process in this way.</p>              <p>''The lesson is when you move into the huge takeover game, there's a huge amount of due diligence you need to do before you announce anything,'' Mr. Andrews-Speed said, adding that in the Cnooc deal, ''they clearly didn't do that on the political side.''</p>                      "
"327","2010-02-17","More Deals Expected In Energy","434299137","New York Times","B.1","            >                                        >                          <p>Energy companies are on the prowl again. </p>              <p>  After a two-year slowdown in mergers and acquisitions in the industry, companies are once again looking for ways to use their checkbooks to expand their reserves, buy new technology or snap up promising oil and gas fields. </p>              <p>  Unlike the round of mergers that created today's behemoths in the late 1990s, the current round is not expected to form new giant companies like Exxon Mobil or ConocoPhillips. This time, companies are focused on buying fast-growing small companies, or on acquisitions that expand their reserves in an era when it is hard for them to find new places to drill.</p>              <p>  The targets include companies that own new fields in nations like Ghana and Sierra Leone, independent gas producers in the United States, and companies that control fields in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico.</p>              <p>  ""In this industry, where you're in the business of increasing your reserves, there are two ways to do so -- to drill or to acquire,"" said Christopher W. Sheehan, director for mergers and acquisitions research at IHS Herold. ""There is an intense competition for access to resources through mergers."" </p>              <p>  This latest wave of consolidation comes amid fresh enthusiasm for natural gas production, especially in the United States, where new technology has significantly expanded the nation's reserves. The huge potential of new gas fields has driven most mergers in the North American energy sector in recent months, with more to come this year, according to bankers and analysts. </p>              <p>  Buying interest is particularly strong among the international oil majors, which sold off many of their onshore assets in the United States over the last decade and are now eager to come back. Anthony B. Hayward, the chief executive of BP, said last month at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that the gas being extracted from beds of shale was ""a complete game-changer. It probably transforms the U.S. energy outlook for the next 100 years.""</p>              <p>  The biggest deal in that sector was announced in December, when Exxon Mobil said it would buy XTO Energy for $31 billion. Shortly after, Total of France said it would pay $800 million for a minority share in Chesapeake Energy's Barnett shale gas portfolio. Chesapeake has raised about $11 billion from joint ventures for its shale gas assets in the last two years; BP and Royal Dutch Shell have struck similar agreements in recent months. </p>              <p>  In a humorous note to investors, Bernstein Research analysts quipped recently: ""Frankly, you can virtually plan your gym sessions around these deals, they are becoming so regular. Thinking about it, isn't it about time for another Statoil deal?""</p>              <p>  Statoil, the Norwegian national oil company, recently struck a deal with ConocoPhillips to trade some of its assets in the Gulf of Mexico for acreage that Conoco holds in the Chukchi Sea of Alaska; in November, Statoil agreed to pay $3.4 billion for a 32.5 percent stake in Chesapeake's assets in the Marcellus shale formation in the Appalachian region.</p>              <p>  ""The growth opportunities from shale gas are something we haven't seen in the United States for decades,"" said Roger D. Read, managing director and senior energy analyst at Natixis Bleichroeder in Houston. ""The United States, which had been a static market, now has the chance to grow its production."" </p>              <p>  Bankers and energy consultants expect deals to pick up this year after a two-year lull. There were 244 deals in the global oil and gas industry last year, down from 285 in 2008, and 336 at the peak in 2007, according to data from IHS Herold, a consulting and advisory firm. </p>              <p>  While the number of transactions was down, the size of the Exxon-XTO transaction helped raise the total value of last year's mergers to $144 billion, up from $104 billion in 2008. (Merger values peaked at $200 billion in 1998, a year when many of today's giant companies  were created.) </p>              <p>  Analysts point to a wide range of companies that are potentially on the market, including EOG Resources, Southwestern Energy, PetroHawk Energy, the Encana Corporation, Chesapeake Energy, Devon Energy and Anadarko Petroleum. </p>              <p>  ""There will be a shakeout there. It will be eat, or be eaten,"" said James Bogues, who leads Accenture's North America energy mergers and acquisition unit. ""Given Exxon's reputation as a very deliberate, cautious company, the fact they made such a bold move with XTO will no doubt inspire others that a price has been set for shale gas assets and technology."" </p>              <p>  Outside of the United States, the pace of mergers has also picked up. Suncor Energy of Canada bought Petro-Canada in a deal valued at $18 billion at the time to form a national giant and stave off possible bids from foreign buyers, particularly Chinese companies. In West Africa, Exxon has offered $4 billion for a stake in an offshore field in Ghana, though that deal could fall through given the government's threat to block the transaction; international firms, including Eni of Italy, are battling over some prospective fields in Uganda. </p>              <p>  Chinese companies have also been particularly active. In August, Sinopec, one of China's biggest oil companies, closed a $9 billion acquisition, buying Addax Petroleum, a Geneva-based oil explorer that is most active in Nigeria, Gabon and the Kurdistan region of Iraq. </p>              <p>  Sinopec, formally known as the China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation, said the deal ""represents the largest successful acquisition of overseas oil and gas assets by a Chinese company.""</p>              <p>  The interest of national oil companies, like Sinopec, could prove a powerful and lasting driver for mergers. </p>              <p>  ""The mandate of national oil companies is to go and find reserves around the world,"" said Jon McCarter, the oil and gas transactions leader for the Americas at Ernst &amp; Young.

The ex-CEO's reputation for running a lean machine was well-deserved, given his successful tenure at NCR. Predecessor Carly Fiorina left him ripe fruit to pick. H-P's operating margins were just 6% when Hurd took the reins. With heavy cost-cutting, he doubled them to 12% as of last quarter.</p>              <p>Mr. Hurd leaves behind a tight ship so juicing margins doesn't look like an option to create shareholder value from here. That means Mr. Hurd's successor will have to look for growth, a tough proposition for a firm already generating $125 billion in sales.</p>              <p>Caris &amp; Co. analyst Robert Cihra estimates that H-P's PC business has driven most revenue growth since Mr. Hurd took over. But operating margins in that business are just 5%. And in the last two quarters, H-P has been losing share to Asian rivals Lenovo Group, and Acer at a faster clip.</p>              <p>H-P's market-leading printing business generates solid 17% margins, but growth is a sluggish 3%, estimates Mr. Cihra. The same is true of its services business, which became a big part of H-P's business with the acquisition of Electronic Data Systems: 16% margins but just 2% growth.</p>              <p>Mr. Hurd was investing in growth, expanding H-P's sales force while acquiring network-equipment company 3Com and mobile-device company Palm. On paper, the two look like decent acquisitions. But both are small relative to H-P's giant revenue base. While 3Com expands H-P's offering for data centers, an attractive area, its sales add just 1% to H-P's total. Palm faces intense competition in the smartphone market.</p>              <p>After the 8% selloff triggered by Mr. Hurd's departure, H-P trades at nine times expected fiscal 2011 earnings, according to Thomson Reuters. That is cheaper than mature megacap technology peers like Intel (10 times), Microsoft (11 times), and nearest rival International Business Machines (11 times). The discount may be deserved: H-P's agglomeration of businesses arguably makes it harder to manage than these companies. To close the gap, which would get the shares back to $50, H-P probably needs to replace Mr. Hurd with another operations guru.</p>              <p>But moving the shares higher than that requires a compelling growth story that would be tough for anyone to deliver. The biggest risk could be that Mr. Hurd's successor tries to make a splash on the acquisition front, overpaying for a fashionable software business, for instance.</p>              <p>Unfortunately for investors, H-P looks to be in a strategic cul-de-sac from which there may be no exit.</p>              <p>Credit: By Rolfe Winkler</p>                      "

Cnooc Ltd.'s $1.1 billion purchase of a 33.3% stake in one of Chesapeake Energy's shale-oil and gas fields is the first Chinese company investment in onshore U.S. energy assets. It comes five years after Cnooc's failure to acquire Unocal, following severe U.S. political hostility.</p>              <p>Chinese oil-and-gas companies have been reluctant to pursue investments in the U.S. since. Indeed, the episode long poisoned the atmosphere for U.S.-China mutual direct investment across all sectors.</p>              <p>Cnooc's new approach shouldn't raise so many hackles. A minority stake in a project isn't a credible threat to national security. Chesapeake will retain operational control of its Eagle Ford shale assets.</p>              <p>Moreover, the U.S. company has prepared the ground. Sovereign-wealth fund China Investment Corp. invested in June alongside peers in Singapore and South Korea. Chesapeake's news release emphasized the benefit to local jobs and tax revenue from the deal.</p>              <p>Since 2005, financial clout has swung Asia's way. Debt-laden Chesapeake could use the Cnooc cash. The Chinese company can easily afford the investment, which could rise to $2.16 billion over two years. And it might benefit from technology transfer.</p>              <p>Whether it generates a decent return is less certain. At least low U.S. gas prices make the stake look cheap. Gordon Kwan at Mirae Asset Securities says the price is about half of the market value, per barrel of oil equivalent, of Cnooc's existing proved reserves.</p>              <p>With Cnooc struggling to expand domestically, shopping abroad makes sense. Assuming Cnooc succeeds this time, its decision to dip a toe in the U.S. may well lead to more.</p>              <p><object class=""mstar_link_to_media""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""6""/><param name=""mstar_lm_alignment"" value=""Left""/><param name=""mstar_lm_display_control"" value=""Embed""/><param name=""mstar_lm_pred_equation"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_type"" value=""Illustration""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_id"" value=""1""/></object></p>              <p>Credit: By Andrew Peaple</p>                      "

That is two days ahead of schedule, after the deal attracted strong demand from large investors, people familiar with the matter said.</p>              <p>For AIG, rescued from the brink of collapse by the U.S. government in September 2008, the completion of the AIA IPO would be a milestone in the insurer's restructuring and attempts to repay a record bailout that used more than $120 billion in taxpayer funds.</p>              <p>AIA shares are expected to price this week, after an offering under way to individual investors, and are to begin trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Oct. 29.</p>              <p>The offering could beat Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China's $16.1 billion deal in 2006 as Hong Kong's biggest IPO.</p>              <p>If AIA prices at the top of the offered range, HK$18.38 to HK$19.68 (US$2.76 to US$2.95) a share, and options are exercised to boost the number of shares offered, AIG could sell as much as 67.1% of its stake in AIA and raise $20.6 billion to pay down its debt to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York this year.</p>              <p>Even if the lower estimate of $13.9 billion is raised, it would still represent the single largest repayment of U.S. taxpayer funds used in the AIG bailout.</p>              <p>AIG shares rose 79 cents, or 1.9%, to $42.26 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>              <p>""The downside is that AIG is parting company with a very valuable and strong entity with excellent long-term growth prospects"" in Asia's life-insurance market, said David Havens, a managing director of credit research at Nomura Securities in New York. The share sale, however, ""will go a long way toward helping AIG disentangle"" from government ownership, he adds.</p>              <p>In the six months ended May 31, 2010, AIA generated about $1.1 billion in operating profit, and it expects operating profit for the full year to be at least $2 billion. Depending on how many AIA shares are sold, AIG will own 32.9% to 51.4% of AIA after the IPO, AIG said in a regulatory filing on Monday.</p>              <p>Earlier this year, a failed deal to sell all of AIA to Prudential PLC of the U.K. (unrelated to Prudential Financial Inc. of the U.S.) for $35.5 billion delayed AIG's plans to repay its bailout, and led the company to revive earlier plans for an AIA IPO and push to complete the offering in the fall of 2010. If the IPO had spilled over into November or December, data on the company's performance as of May 31 risked looking stale, said people familiar with the deal.</p>              <p>In June, prospects for AIA's listing looked grim as global markets were wrestling with a sovereign debt crisis in Europe. AIG's bankers fanned out to find sovereign-wealth funds or insurers willing to take a chunk of AIA prior to the IPO; in the words of one of those bankers, ""no stone was left unturned.""</p>              <p>AIA lacked a big selling point that had helped another large share sale succeed over the summer, China's biggest bank by customers Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.'s $22.1 billion IPO. While AIA is the only foreign insurer with a license of its own to sell life insurance in China, it commands only a 1% share of the market for the world's second-largest economy.</p>              <p>Still, investors saw AIA's IPO as a chance to get exposure to Asia at a time when global funds were shifting more money into emerging markets. Asia's IPO markets have also been more active and receptive to new deals than the U.S., where new stock issuance is relatively sluggish compared with historic norms.</p>              <p>Chinese investors, including the country's sovereign-wealth fund, China Investment Corp., as well as China Life Insurance Co. and Taikang Life Insurance Co., put in bids for the offering, one of the people said. AIG's bankers are advising clients to pitch any last-minute bids at the top end of the IPO's price range if they want to help ensure they get a piece of the deal.</p>              <p>CIC declined to comment.</p>              <p>China Life and Taikang didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>              <p>One key decision that helped boost demand for the offering was pricing. Against a backdrop of wilting global stock markets, AIG and its advisers pegged AIA's valuation at US$28.5 billion to $30.5 billion. The high end was in line with the $30.4 billion Britain's Prudential was willing to pay for all of AIA after pressure from its own shareholders forced it to cut an earlier offer.</p>              <p>Pinning a lower initial market value on AIA effectively increased the likelihood that buyers of AIA shares would profit from a rise in value after the shares started trading. Bankers essentially bet that the approach would help attract demand and bump up the value of AIG's remaining stake in AIA, according to people familiar with the deal. That would enable AIG to sell more of its remaining stake later on in secondary offerings. Analysts note that given AIG's earlier setbacks in selling AIA, the company probably didn't have a lot of maneuvering room to set the AIA IPO price too high.</p>              <p>Good timing pitched in as a global market rally gathered steam in October.</p>              <p>---</p>              <p>Nisha Gopalan, Prudence Ho and Lynn Cowan contributed to this article.</p>              <p>Credit: By Alison Tudor and Serena Ng</p>                      "

But the move could result in culture clashes and political angst on the scale of Japan's global takeover splurge during its bubble years.</p>              <p>Companies in China have been aggressive bidders for overseas assets, with their M&amp;A strategy dominated by snapping up iron ore, oil and other natural resources needed to power the country's growth engine.</p>              <p>Now, though, ""we're beginning to see a second wave of M&amp;A initiatives diversifying away from those heavy industries,"" Wang Ran, chief executive of boutique investment bank China eCapital Corp., said at The Wall Street Journal's China Financial Markets conference in Beijing earlier this month.</p>              <p>Chinese firms have snapped up stakes in French skin-care firm L'Occitane International SA for $50 million and Japan's Honma Golf Co. for an undisclosed sum.</p>              <p>And interest is growing in Hollywood film studios and movie libraries. Movie-production company Shanghai Film Group Corp. is hunting for an acquisition in the U.S., said a spokeswoman for the state-owned company. She declined to comment on potential interest in Hollywood studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., which filed for bankruptcy-court protection earlier this month.</p>              <p>Merger veterans in China note that some European companies are particularly interested in deals that would help them sell to wealthy Chinese. In June, Shanghai-based conglomerate Fosun International Ltd. bought a 7.1% stake in Club Mediterranee SA, known as Club Med, for an undisclosed sum. The French holiday-resort operator plans to make China its second-largest market within five years.</p>              <p>Oil and gas companies still are targeted by Chinese buyers more than firms in any other industry. This year, Chinese companies have bought 280 companies for a combined $50 billion, according to Dealogic.</p>              <p>Investment bankers, lawyers and executives in China expect a surge in takeovers by consumer-driven companies as the country's planned economy shifts away from dependence on low-cost exporters toward growth from domestic consumption. The hope is that bolstering the income of ordinary households and a rising middle class will provide more sustainable growth.</p>              <p>Economists expect China's 12th five-year plan, which begins in 2011, to endorse the remodeling of the economy.</p>              <p>Among 1,363 individuals in China with fortunes exceeding $150 million, just 5% made their money from export-focused businesses, according to Hurun Report, a Shanghai-based group that follows China's wealth trends. Instead, the richest Chinese are making money from sectors that rely on Chinese consumers. Zong Qinghou, head of drinks company Wahaha Group, tops Hurun's ranking with a $12 billion fortune.</p>              <p>These newly minted multimillionaires are expanding their companies in China, which they see as less risky, but are also seeking foreign-branded products to sell within the world's fastest-growing economy.</p>              <p>""There is a good and consistent level of dialogue with Chinese consumer companies relating to potential overseas opportunities,"" said Colin Banfield, head of Asian mergers and acquisitions for Citigroup Inc. in Hong Kong. ""The issue has been moving it beyond just talk.""</p>              <p>Expansion-hungry Chinese companies are likely to encounter some of the same resistance that has snarled foreign deals in nonconsumer industries. To ease fears of the ""800-pound gorilla that's called China,"" acquirers should communicate extensively with regulators and the public before pouncing, said Fred Hu, chairman of Primavera Capital Corp.</p>              <p>Some experts predict the increased takeover interest in non-Chinese consumer-goods companies will have repercussions for the debate over theft of intellectual property. U.S. business leaders and officials have complained frequently about China's track record.</p>              <p>In addition, Chinese state-owned companies often have to wait for the central government's approval before launching a bid. And officials in the home country of companies targeted by Chinese firms often are suspicious of the political agenda behind the acquisition.</p>              <p>When China's Sinochem Corp. explored ways of acquiring Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan this fall, it struggled to find allies. A person familiar with the matter said it would have been difficult to align the interests of an investor focused on making a financial return on the acquisition with the goals of Sinochem, which was chiefly interested in maximizing potash production.</p>              <p>Chinese acquisitions of consumer companies are likely to be less politically sensitive than natural-resources deals that have been met with storms of protest from Canada to Australia.</p>              <p>But major consumer deals could trigger comparisons to when Japanese companies sought trophy assets in the U.S. in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p>              <p>The purchases of New York City's Rockefeller Center and the Pebble Beach golf course in California caused public outbursts. And some Japanese deals quickly ran into trouble as the new owners tried to manage their purchases.</p>              <p>Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. had a combative relationship with the management of Hollywood movie studio MCA Inc., eventually selling its 80% stake in 1995.</p>              <p>Wu Yibing, president of Citic Private Equity Funds Management Co., said the biggest struggle for acquisitive Chinese companies is integrating the target. If Chinese managers were to ask themselves if they could manage foreign companies, ""I would say 90% of the rational Chinese buyers would answer no,"" Mr. Wu said.</p>              <p>Natural-resources deals have dominated the M&amp;A landscape for expansion-hungry Chinese companies partly because they are simpler to manage, Mr. Wu said.</p>              <p>Consumer-products makers have the added difficulty of maintaining the value of the brands they buy and tailoring products to Chinese tastes. China's Bright Food Group's planned acquisition of United Biscuits, Britain's biggest snack-food group, fell through this month partly because it struggled with the idea of managing the maker of McVitie's biscuits and Hula Hoops.</p>              <p>Howard Chao, a partner at law firm O'Melveny &amp; Myers LLP, said Chinese interest in the film-animation industry is strong, but acquirers will have to carefully manage the creative process and make sure the Chinese government is comfortable with the content being distributed in China.</p>              <p>China is expected to become the second-largest film market in the world by 2012, according to Dublin-based Research and Markets.</p>              <p><object class=""mstar_link_to_media""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""6""/><param name=""mstar_lm_alignment"" value=""Left""/><param name=""mstar_lm_display_control"" value=""Embed""/><param name=""mstar_lm_pred_equation"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_type"" value=""Illustration""/><param name=""mstar_lm_media_id"" value=""1""/></object></p>              <p>Credit: By Alison Tudor</p>                      "

And it said it would buy out Sempra Generation's 50% of the Elk Hills power plant near Bakersfield, bringing its ownership to 100%.</p>              <p>Occidental President Stephen I. Chazen, who will take over as chief executive from Ray R. Irani next year, said in an interview that the company had kept to ""our core areas in California and Texas"" while taking advantage of a rare chance to buy a large parcel in the sprawling Bakken oil shale field in North Dakota, a formation believed to hold 3.5 billion to 5 billion barrels of oil. Occidental is purchasing about 180,000 acres in North Dakota from a private seller for $1.4 billion.</p>              <p>""We made a toehold investment there a few years ago,"" Chazen said. ""This was an opportunity to acquire a large block of contiguous acreage where we can control our own destiny.""</p>              <p>Irani said in a statement that after the transactions close in the first quarter, they would add to earnings immediately and make it ""more certain"" that average annual production growth reaches the previously announced range of 5% to 8%.</p>              <p>To industry experts, the Occidental deal was a sign of several things, including the increasing attractiveness of U.S. land-based oil and gas assets far from the whims of foreign governments and the risks of deepwater offshore drilling. In June, Exxon Mobil Corp. bought independent XTO Energy Inc. for $40 billion, and last month, Chevron Corp. said it would acquire oil-shale firm Atlas Energy Inc. for $4.3 billion.</p>              <p>""There are some good domestic oil reserves out there, but some companies and private parties already involved can't exploit them as much as they would like because they don't have the cash,"" said Brian Youngberg, an oil analyst with Edward Jones &amp; Co. in St. Louis. ""Occidental was well positioned to acquire some of that acreage to accelerate development and speed up production.""</p>              <p>Phil Weiss of Argus Research said that a seemingly minor part of Friday's announcement -- Occidental signed an agreement to increase its ownership in Plains All-American to approximately 35% -- was another shrewd component of maximizing control and minimizing costs involved with exploiting the new acquisitions.</p>              <p>Plains is one of the largest operators of oil pipelines in North America, with operations in Texas, California, North Dakota and other areas.</p>              <p>""These pipelines are like toll roads,"" Weiss said. ""You have to pay to move your product through them, so they just bought some of the toll road. When they own a bigger piece of it, it reduces their costs.""</p>              <p>The Texas site Occidental is purchasing will be acquired from Shell, which has owned and operated the property for several years, for about $1.8 billion. The south Texas assets produce approximately 200 million cubic feet a day of natural gas equivalent.

""They get 30% of their production from the Permian Basin, and it's typical of what Occidental can do.

These acquisitions and IPOs may not be the biggest, but that is a boringly objective metric. Rather, the picks reflect such admittedly subjective criteria as: what deals helped spark an important trend, catapulted an obscure company or deal maker into sudden renown? Anyway, here is our list:</p>              <p>-- Hewlett-Packard/3Par</p>              <p>Data storer 3Par was hardly a household name but it became the target of a furious summer ping-pong match between tech giants Dell and Hewlett-Packard. After bids soared 83% from Dell's first lob, H-P emerged with a $2.1 billion prize -- 240% more than 3Par's market value before the initial offer.</p>              <p>The wild war between the two giants held the technology and M&amp;A worlds rapt and underscored the rising demand for data storage. In the subsequent months, International Business Marchines bought Netezza for about $1.7 billion, and EMC agreed to scoop up Isilon Systems for about $2.25 billion.</p>              <p>-- Cnooc/Bridas Energy</p>              <p>-- Sinopec/Occidental Petroleum's Argentina unit</p>              <p>-- Sinopec/a stake in Repsol's Brazilian offshore-oil unit</p>              <p>-- Cnooc-Bridas/Pan American Energy stake</p>              <p>This quartet of splashy energy deals cemented energy and China as the biggest 2010 deal themes. The deals led by Cnooc, the Chinese state-owned oil company, and giant refiner Sinopec also showed that China and Brazil increasingly can bypass the U.S. and do deals with each other.</p>              <p>And whether in China, Latin America or elsewhere, the 2010 M&amp;A roster was energy-rich. There were $306.5 billion of oil-and-gas M&amp;A in 2010, according to preliminary data from Dealogic, or 11% of total global deal volume. That is the highest on record for the oil-and-gas sector, Dealogic said.</p>              <p>-- AIA Group IPO</p>              <p>If the U.S. government's bailout of the financial world was the story of 2008 and 2009, extricating taxpayers out of those investments was the theme for 2010 (and perhaps for 2011). Although the rescue of Citigroup and General Motors perhaps drew more attention, saving the drowning insurer American International Group cost Uncle Sam $182 billion. The AIA Asian life insurance business was a crown jewel of AIG, and it was stuck in a takeover tug of war with the U.S. taxpayer coming out on top.</p>              <p>AIG first considered an IPO of the unit, only to spike that when Prudential PLC offered $35.5 billion to buy AIA. In gamble for AIG, and for U.S. taxpayers, the board turned down that offer after the U.K. insurer cut the price twice. Instead, AIA sold two-thirds of itself in a Hong Kong listing that raised $20.5 billion and valued AIA at $36 billion, more than the first Prudential offer.</p>              <p>-- BHP Billiton-Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan</p>              <p>Two words: Brad Wall. The premier of Saskatchewan became the scourge of at least two continents, Europe and Australia, after he helped orchestrate public opposition to BHP hostile takeover of the Canadian treasure few had heard of.</p>              <p>In the end, the deal had everything: protectionist harrumphing, never-materialized rumored bids from the Chinese and the Russians, a secret white knight in the form of an ad hoc collection of First Nations members, and finally a surprise block by the Canadian government. It was the third big BHP transaction to go down in flames.</p>              <p>More deeply, the BHP-Potash fracas left even the most capitalism-supporting Westerners to ponder an uncomfortable question: how supportive are we really of foreign takeovers?</p>              <p>Credit: By Shira Ovide</p>                      "

Morgan Chase &amp; Co.'s James Dimon, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.'s Henry Kravis and Carlyle Group's David Rubenstein all visited China in recent months, the trips were seen as something else entirely: crucial steps to keep their respective companies growing.</p>              <p>China has been important to global economic growth for years, of course. The country likely emerged as the world's second-largest economy in 2010. It is expected to show close to 10% growth in both 2010 and 2011.</p>              <p>Until recently, however, China was something of a sideshow for many financial professionals. Global growth was key to China's health, and the country had an impact on many economies. But China didn't seem to matter much to most deal makers and wealth creators.</p>              <p>That's all changing. China is opening its markets, slightly loosening the reins on its currency, and is emerging as a key to the future of almost every Wall Street firm. It's also a linchpin of the investment strategies of a growing number of hedge- and private-equity funds.</p>              <p>Consider that global initial public offerings of Chinese companies amounted to $104 billion in 2010, according to data-tracker Dealogic, up from $54 billion in 2009. Last year's tally amounts to $126 billion if Hong Kong companies are included, though it includes domestic markets not fully accessible to foreigners.</p>              <p>By comparison, less than $34 billion of U.S. IPOs took place in 2010, the second consecutive year that Chinese companies topped U.S. companies in IPO issuance. Bankers that didn't participate in Chinese IPOs risked seeing smaller bonuses. No Chinese investment bank has emerged as a global power, reducing alibis for not establishing a presence in deals available to foreigners.</p>              <p>Meanwhile, mergers-and-acquisitions specialists are racing to China to work with companies like China National Offshore Oil Corp., known as Cnooc, and China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corp., or Sinopec, among the biggest deal makers in 2010. Chinese companies completed 3,235 acquisitions valued at nearly $190 billion, or 9% of all global deals in 2010. That was more than any other nation except the U.S. and more than the $162 billion of deals by U.K.-based companies. China also was the second-most frequent target of purchases by foreign companies in 2010, after the U.S.</p>              <p>In currency markets, analysts say more traders are laying big bets on whether the yuan will be allowed to appreciate further in 2011. Stock-trading volume on Chinese and Hong Kong exchanges now rivals that of U.S. markets. And some strategists, such as Tobias Levkovich of Citigroup, view the Shanghai market as a leading indicator for U.S. shares.</p>              <p>The Chinese economy is expanding so quickly it's helping to offset stagnant growth elsewhere in the world for a growing number of companies. And Chinese demand increasingly drives global commodity prices and shares of commodity providers.</p>              <p>That all helps explain why some of the largest investors are boosting wagers on -- and against -- China. The bulls say power will continue to shift to developing makets from developed countries. They cite China as exhibit A of this trend, arguing there are more opportunities in China and elsewhere in Asia than in the U.S. or Europe.</p>              <p>Already, some of the hottest investments over the past year, including rare-earth shares like Molycorp Inc. and Rare Element Resources Ltd., get their mojo from tightening Chinese controls or rising demand in the country.</p>              <p>Daniel Arbess, who runs a hedge fund for Perella Weinberg Partners, has been profiting by buying shares of global companies helped by Chinese growth, a strategy he calls ""Shake Hands With China,"" and betting against those having a hard time competing with Chinese rivals.</p>              <p>Mr. Arbess is focused on companies like Solutia Inc., Apple Inc. and Yum Brands Inc. that are growing quickly in China, as well as those that produce commodities in demand in China. For example, Yum, the owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands, saw same-store sales rise in each division for the first time since the end of 2008. China enjoyed a 6% gain, while the U.S. and other international locations posted 1% growth.</p>              <p>But many investors find it challenging to directly wager on China. Few companies have enough shares outstanding, or trade with sufficient activity, to make larger investors feel comfortable making a substantial investment. A relative lack of financial and regulatory transparency also is a hindrance.</p>              <p>A recent incident is a reminder of the need to be wary: China Gas Holdings Ltd., a large natural-gas distributor, announced in late December that two of its executives were escorted from the company's offices by people claiming to represent the Shenzhen Municipal Public Security Bureau. China Gas said it hadn't been able to get in touch with executives, nor has the company been told why the executives were detained.</p>              <p>The incident has flummoxed firms providing analytical coverage of China Gas. UBS, for instance, produces estimates of China Gas's results through 2013. But as of last week, the firm, along with investors, had no details about the executives, and told clients it wasn't sure if the incident would affect the company's operations. The matter hadn't been resolved as the year ended and the stock remains suspended from trading.</p>              <p>That's all part of the reason China also is the target of some of the biggest short-sellers, such as James Chanos, who runs hedge fund Kynikos Advisors.</p>              <p>The bears also point to China's expensive real-estate market and so-called ghost cities that relatively few inhabit, despite billions poured into them by Beijing. Mr. Chanos is shorting Chinese property companies based in Hong Kong, among other shares.</p>              <p>""Large-scale capital projects grow sillier by the day,"" Mr. Chanos said at a recent conference, in which he focused on what he called a ""record lending spree in China"" that is ""fueling a speculative boom."" Indeed, fixed-asset investment grew 23.5% last year, and is forecast to grow 20% this year; analysts say banks far exceeded China's central bank's cap on lending in 2010.</p>              <p>Meanwhile, many private-equity firms are racing to cut deals in China, to tap into the nation's growth -- and to demonstrate to clients that they're capable of finding opportunities in China.</p>              <p>Mr. Kravis's KKR is putting the finishing touches on a $1 billion fund to invest in fast-growing companies in China, its first China-focused fund after several years of investing in China through broader funds. Rivals like TPG and Carlyle, which have long has been active in China, are stepping up activity. TPG recently announced plans to raise two Chinese currency-denominated funds, each sized at more than $700 million.</p>              <p>To be sure, a number of private-equity and hedge-fund chiefs privately share frustrations about China, even as they search for local opportunities. The rule of law is weak, some say, making it harder to resolve disputes. Others question the reliability of data published by private and public bodies, or aren't sure who controls Chinese companies, which usually are influenced by government officials.</p>              <p>Still other private-equity executives worry that assets in the eastern part of the country are so picked-over that they're heading to central and western hinterlands to find opportunities.</p>              <p>Some see this shift as a sign that these investors are embracing risk. Indeed, experts say it's even more difficult to obtain reliable data or gain influence over local businesses in these parts of China. There's some rationale to the strategy, however. Although the eastern region has long dominated the country, central and western China surpassed the eastern region on most measures of growth in 2010, according to Nomura International, including gross-domestic-product growth, retail sales growth, export and imports.</p>              <p>""The western region's growth is accelerating, thanks to rising demand for and rapid development of resources and related industries,"" Nomura says.</p>              <p>At the same time, it's risky to bet against an economy with $2.6 trillion of foreign currency reserves and where the majority of the population is only beginning to fully urbanize and embrace higher standards of living, a trend likely to bring more investment opportunities.</p>              <p>The question for 2011 and beyond is whether Chinese authorities can keep the country growing apace, even as they press the brakes on inflation, which is growing at a clip of more than 5%. Strong future growth may come only if Chinese leaders can transform the nation into a consumer-focused economy.</p>              <p>Whether Chinese development and growth can continue without major setbacks could be more important to global markets and financial firms than anything the Federal Reserve or European Union do in 2011.</p>              <p>""The transition to a consumer society in China represents the single biggest challenge for the global economy,"" says Perella Weinberg's Mr. Arbess, ""and the biggest opportunity for markets.""</p>              <p>(See related article: ""Markets Continued to Benefit From Intervention in 2010; Now, the Question Is, Can the Fed and Others Exit Neatly?

"336","2011-03-15","China's Energy Industry Makes a Bold Push Into Developed Markets","856929054","New York Times","B.7","            >                                        >                          <p>PetroChina agreed last month to buy a 50 percent stake in a Canadian gas venture for $5.4 billion. If the deal goes through, it will be the largest overseas acquisition on record for the Chinese oil company.</p>              <p>  The transaction will also signify a shift in the merger and acquisition strategy of the Chinese energy industry. For decades, major players like PetroChina, Sinopec and Cnooc focused on building out their operations in politically volatile regions like Sudan, Venezuela and Iran. Now, they are competing with the multinational giants on their own turf, striking partnerships and joint ventures in the United States, Canada and Latin America.</p>              <p>  China is becoming an important driver of energy mergers. In 2009 and 2010, Chinese oil companies struck nearly $50 billion of deals outside their borders, roughly 5 percent of the industry total.</p>              <p>  The effort comes as companies in more developed markets are pulling back or divesting assets. Last year, majors like Statoil, ConocoPhillips and BP were net sellers.</p>              <p>  Deal-making is part of the country's broader energy goals. With a population of 1.3 billion and a fast-growing economy, China is the world's largest energy consumer and the biggest polluter.</p>              <p>  But its energy demands are quickly outstripping its supplies, leaving the economy vulnerable to disruptions like the current Middle East turmoil. China, once Asia's most important oil exporter, started importing in 1993. With domestic production stagnating, the country generated 3.99 million barrels a day - less than half the annual consumption. The International Energy Agency estimates China will have to rely on imports for 79 percent of its oil needs by 2030.</p>              <p>  ""They have a lot of money, a lack of energy security, and their import dependency is not getting any better,"" said Paul Ting, an expert on China energy policy who runs an industry consultancy firm. ""They've just got to get energy any way they can.""</p>              <p>  The country's oil majors recognized the supply problem decades ago. After Deng Xiaoping opened up the Chinese economy, PetroChina, Sinopec and Cnooc slowly moved to expand overseas. With large multinationals or state-run companies already in control of the better oil fields, Chinese players had to focus on the more volatile and politically vulnerable regions.</p>              <p>  ""They were late-comers to the game, and a lot of the good assets were taken,"" said Julie Jiang, an analyst at the International Energy Agency. ""They went to difficult areas.""</p>              <p>  In 1996, PetroChina's parent entered Sudan, which has a history of civil war and human rights abuses that has kept many multinationals away. Despite worldwide protests, PetroChina built a significant operation in the territory, which now accounts for 3 percent of China's oil imports. The big three now operate in 31 countries, including Angola, Venezuela and, until recently, Libya.</p>              <p>  Before the financial crisis, ""their reputation greatly exceeded what they were doing,"" said Erica S. Downs, a Brookings Institution scholar who has written on Chinese oil companies' changing strategies. ""If you look at 2009 and 2010, they're going for bigger-ticket items. They want to compete with the Exxon Mobils and the Shells of the world.""</p>              <p>  PetroChina, Sinopec and Cnooc declined to comment.</p>              <p>  Buyers are treading more cautiously than in the past. In 2005, Cnooc made an $18.5 billion hostile bid for Unocal in the United States. The prominent deal was quickly quashed by political opposition - a humbling experience that prompted the Chinese to reassess their aggressive stance overseas.</p>              <p>  Now, the country's energy leaders are moving into the Americas in friendlier ways by taking smaller stakes or creating joint ventures. Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm, said that even the banner year the major players had in 2010 was characterized by nothing more than a ""steady stream of midsized deals."" For example, Sinopec joined up with Total of France to buy a 9 percent stake in Syncrude, a unit of ConocoPhillips in Houston, for $4.65 billion.</p>              <p>  Chinese oil companies ""are on a steep learning curve, but they've come up it quite some way,"" said a banker familiar with the industry deal-making who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. ""They're all conversant with Western culture and Western deal-doing.""</p>              <p>  They're also learning to play politics. When Cnooc announced it was buying one-third of Chesapeake Energy's south Texas shale assets for $1.1 billion last October, it established the first successful onshore move by a Chinese oil company in the United States.</p>              <p>  According to people with knowledge of the deal, Cnooc got the transaction ""precleared"" by the Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States, a panel that monitors national security issues related to mergers and acquisitions. Cnooc management would not have gone ahead without that tacit approval, the people said.</p>              <p>  ""It's not like there's a prohibition on Chinese companies buying energy assets in the United States,"" said Bob Schlossberg, a partner at the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in Washington. ""But politics, let's face it, does play a part.""</p>              <p>  This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. </p>              <div><object class=""mstar_text_entity""><param name=""pq_source"" value=""csx""/><param name=""pq_etype"" value=""39""/><param name=""mstar_entity_inline"" value=""N""/><param name=""mstar_entity_type"" value=""Photograph""/><div class=""Photograph_content""><p>An Oil Sands Mine in Fort Mcmurray, Alberta, That Is Operated by Syncrude, a Joint Venture of Several Companies, Including China's Sinopec.

Including DPL's net debt, the planned deal has an enterprise value of $4.7 billion.</p>              <p>With headquarters in Dayton, DPL supplies power to about 500,000 customers in west central Ohio through its subsidiaries. The merger with AES, which supplies power to about half a million customers through the Indianapolis Power &amp; Light Co., will help expand the combined company's footprint in the midwestern U.S., AES Chief Executive Paul Hanrahan said in an interview. The deal will add between 5 cents and 7 cents to AES's expected 2012 earnings, the outlook for which has not been released yet, Mr. Hanrahan said.</p>              <p>Mr. Hanrahan added that the U.S. utilities sector, which has several small and midsize companies, offers opportunities for consolidation. Combining some of AES's operations with DPL's will bring regional scale to the business and help make it more efficient, he said.</p>              <p>Founded in 1981, AES is based in Arlington, Va., but operates power generation and distribution businesses in 28 countries, serving 11.5 million customers. The company generates 40,500 megawatts of electricity from diverse sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar. In 2009, China Investment Corp. paid $1.58 billion for a 15% stake in AES. CIC is the Chinese government's sovereign wealth fund.</p>              <p>DPL, which traces its roots back 100 years, generates 3,800 megawatts of electricity mainly through coal-fired plants and some natural gas generation capacity. It has roughly 1,500 employees and had a market capitalization of $3.2 billion Tuesday. AES, which employs 29,000 people, had a market value of just under $10 billion.</p>              <p>The deal with AES will benefit both customers and shareholders, Glenn Harder, chairman of the board of DPL, said in a statement.

The Miller field was the first major find for Hayward, then a 25-year-old geology PhD from the University of Edinburgh. It became one of BP's most productive North Sea assets, yielding 345 million barrels of oil over its lifetime.</p>              <p>The worst moments of Hayward's BP career are far better known. On April 20, 2010, BP's Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico exploded, killing 11 workers on the Deepwater Horizon oil platform and unleashing the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history.</p>              <p>The disaster erased more than $100 billion from BP's market value in two months, and the company took a $41 billion charge against income to cover fines, cleanup costs and compensation to gulf fishermen and property owners.</p>              <p>Macondo also cost Hayward his job as BP's chief executive officer after a string of public relations fiascoes that included his saying ""I would like my life back"" to reporters while touring an oil-slicked beach in Louisiana.</p>              <p>Although Hayward's reputation in the United States took a hit after the spill, he is welcome in the oil patch. ""People know he was the scapegoat,"" says Fadel Gheit, oil and gas analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</p>              <p>Now, Hayward, 54, is getting his life back. A year after leaving BP, he's again at the helm of a publicly traded company. He teamed up with financier Nathaniel Rothschild, scion of the banking family, to create Vallares, a shell company that raised $2.15 billion through an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange on June 17.</p>              <p>Hayward also serves on the board of TNK-BP International, BP's fractious Russian joint venture. Glencore International, the mining and commodities-trading company that went public in London and Hong Kong in May, raising $10.3 billion, named him its senior non-executive director.</p>              <p>Help wanted</p>              <p>The International Energy Agency forecasts an average price of $103 per barrel in the next five years compared with $79 per barrel in the past five, and experienced executives such as Hayward are in demand.</p>              <p>""High-quality people are not easy to come by,"" says Christine Tiscareno, an oil and gas analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>              <p>Hayward says he hopes to re-create the excitement of his early career at Vallares, which is seeking oil industry acquisitions in emerging markets.</p>              <p>""I am a geologist, and that remains very much in my blood,"" he says. ""I love the exploration end of the business.""</p>              <p>As he works to restore his reputation, Hayward could be courting new risks. Vallares, the company he founded with Rothschild, 40, is a blank-check company: It had no assets when it went public. Such firms have stirred controversy by allowing less-than-transparent emerging-markets companies to obtain stock exchange listings in London and the United States.</p>              <p>Given BP's environmental record, environmentalists are snickering about Hayward's role at Glencore, whose prospectus included reports of water pollution, hazardous dust and toxic clouds at its mines. Hayward was named to the Glencore board's health, safety and environment committee.</p>              <p>Charlie Kronick, climate adviser for Greenpeace, says, ""These are industries that are increasingly operating at the edge, and when you operate at the edge, there is a good chance you'll fall off.""</p>              <p>Hayward says Vallares plans to target companies in such places as Russia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. He says the most likely candidates are privately owned, family-controlled companies that lack the ability to raise capital or attract talent.</p>              <p>""For an emerging-market company, privately owned, to come to the London market is a three- or four-year process with no guarantee of success,"" Hayward says. ""So to have the opportunity to merge with the sort of thing we've created can be very attractive.""</p>              <p>Joining Hayward and Rothschild are Julian Metherell, 48, former co-head of British investment banking at Goldman Sachs Group, and Tom Daniel, 46, a fund manager who helped Rothschild start an earlier company. The four partners have committed about $163 million of their own money to the project.</p>              <p>In reverse mergers, a shell company uses its stock to buy an operating company. It winds up with the assets, but the target company's shareholders gain a controlling interest in the former shell company's shares.</p>              <p>In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission has warned that reverse mergers allow foreign businesses to bypass the usual listing requirements.</p>              <p>'Less-quality companies'</p>              <p>""It only makes sense to go the reverse-merger route if there is a reason you could not go the traditional route,"" says William Sjostrom, a professor at the University of Arizona's law school. ""That means an underwriter looked under the hood and said no, so you are getting less-quality companies.""</p>              <p>Vallares is modeled on Vallar, a blank-check company Rothschild founded with James Campbell, a veteran mining executive, and took public on the London Stock Exchange last summer, raising $1.2 million. In its prospectus, Vallar said only that it intended to acquire a company in base metals, iron ore or coal mining.</p>              <p>""There are not many people in the world who can raise a billion dollars and say, 'Hey, we'll tell you what it's for later,' but Nat Rothschild is one of them,"" says Richard Knights, an analyst at Liberum Capital in London.</p>              <p>Four months after going public, Vallar acquired stakes in two closely linked Indonesian coal-mining companies in a $3 billion reverse merger. The deal made Bakrie Group, run by the Indonesian family of the same name, Vallar's largest single shareholder, with a 54.6 percent stake valued at more than $1.8 billion.</p>              <p>PT Bumi Resources, the Bakries' coal-mining company, thus became the first Indonesian company to in effect obtain a listing on the London Stock Exchange. In July, Vallar changed its name to Bumi.</p>              <p>Investor interest in Hayward's Vallares was so intense that the company raised $534 millionmore than planned.</p>              <p>Investors in London and New York show a growing appetite for blank-check companies. Last year, there were seven such IPOs in London, up from none in 2009.</p>              <p>In the United States, 14 such companies have gone public as of mid-August, compared with seven in 2010 and one in 2009, according to SPAC Investments, a research firm that specializes in blank-check companies.</p>              <p>With his focus on emerging markets, Hayward risks tying up with a company that isn't used to Western standards of governance. One of the firms that Vallares has begun discussing an acquisition with is Genel Enerji, a Turkish firm with oil fields in northern Iraq, says a person familiar with the matter.</p>              <p>The British Financial Services Authority fined Genel chief executive Mehmet Sepil $1.6 million in February 2010 for insider trading involving a previous attempt to sell the company to British-based Heritage Oil. (Sepil admitted making the trades but said he didn't know doing so was illegal, according to a company statement.) Vallares has also looked at buying stakes in Russian oil companies Bashneft and NK RussNeft, both partially owned by AFK Sistema, the company controlled by billionaire Vladimir Yevtushenkov. Vallares declined to comment on the potential deals.</p>              <p>Hayward also should be concerned about potential pitfalls at Glencore, says Karina Litvack of F&amp;C Asset Management in London.</p>              <p>""The company faces a challenge in gaining the trust of the outside world in terms of its governance and sustainability record,"" Litvack says, because Vallares and Glencore are both looking for investments in the same sector.</p>              <p>Link to Glencore</p>              <p>In addition, Rothschild is a major Glencore bondholder as well as a friend of Glencore chief executive Ivan Glasenberg. ""Nat Rothschild is friendly with half the world,"" Hayward says with a chuckle. ""If there ever was a conflict, I would recuse myself, obviously."" Rothschild declined requests for an interview.</p>              <p>Hayward, the eldest of seven children, was born in Slough, an industrial town west of London. His father was a mid-level manager in a textile mill; his mother, an administrator at Britain's National Health Service. His undergraduate degree is from Aston University in Birmingham.</p>              <p>Hayward's big break at BP came in 1990, when John Browne, the company's head of exploration and production and later its chief executive, tapped him to be a Turtle - a name derived from the cartoon ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."" Selected in pairs each year, the Turtles served as Browne's aides-de-camp, standing at his elbow as he negotiated multibillion-dollar deals as well as making sure that his office was stocked with El Rey del Mundo Cuban cigars and bottles of Montrachet.</p>              <p>Hayward was steadily promoted, becoming chief of BP's exploration and production division, the company's main profit driver, in 2003. In 2007, when Browne resigned after becoming embroiled in a scandal involving his personal life, the board unanimously chose Hayward to replace him.</p>              <p>Browne had concentrated on megamergers and branding BP with his ""beyond petroleum"" campaign. Toward the end of his tenure, though, BP was plagued by costly project delays and safety and maintenance flaws. A blast in 2005 at BP's refinery in Texas killed 15 people and injured more than 170.</p>              <p>In 2006, BP was forced to stop pumping oil from its Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska after oil leaked from a corroded pipeline.</p>              <p>Hayward closed the office Browne had opened for BP's renewable-energy division and pushed BP into Canadian oil sands. He fired 6,500 workers. He wanted to improve BP's safety record and strive for operational excellence.</p>              <p>BP's share price on the London Stock Exchange rebounded 16 percent from the time Hayward became chief executive through April 20, 2010 - the day the Deepwater Horizon exploded.</p>              <p>'Hit by a bus'</p>              <p>The disaster thrust Hayward into a role for which he was ill-prepared, according to a friend who also worked at BP. Hayward was uncomfortable speaking before crowds and on camera, says the friend, who asked not to be named. Hayward was philosophical about the disaster.</p>              <p>""Sometimes you step off the pavement and get hit by a bus,"" he told reporters while announcing his resignation.</p>              <p>Whether Vallares is a success will depend on which company it acquires. Oil fields have been garnering sky-high prices as national oil companies from China, India and Russia expand. In October 2010, China Petroleum &amp; Chemical, known as Sinopec, purchased 40 percent of the Brazilian arm of Spanish oil company Repsol YPF for $7.1 billion - more than $2 billion above analysts' consensus estimate of the stake's value.</p>              <p>The ghost of Macondo still dogs Hayward. He's a defendant in two consolidated class-action lawsuits in the United States resulting from Macondo, which could cost BP $6 billion, according to a Citigroup estimate.</p>              <p>Yet the demand for experienced oil and gas hands is such that reincarnation is always possible. Win or lose with Vallares, Hayward is likely to have plenty more chances to get his life back.</p>              <p>The full version of this Bloomberg Markets story is in the October issue.</p>                      "

The 20 most active countries in the emerging and frontier markets - nations found in Latin America, the Middle East, Asia and sub-Saharan Africa - have notched nearly $377 billion of deals this year, up roughly 3 percent from the same period in 2010, according to Thomson Reuters.</p>              <p>  The countries share a common characteristic: a growing economy. China's gross domestic product increased by an estimated 10.3 percent last year, India's by 10.4 percent and Peru's by 8.8 percent. In contrast, the United States economy rose 2.8 percent.</p>              <p>  But forging deals in developing regions comes with a unique set of uncertainties, including political, economic and regulatory risks. Wal-Mart Stores pulled out of Moscow late last year, citing an inhospitable climate for acquisitions. Ikea, fed up with corruption in Russia, suspended further investments there in 2009.</p>              <p>  In Brazil, rising inflation has spooked investors, contributing to a 26 percent decline this year in the MSCI Brazil index. As the market wobbles, merger activity has declined by nearly a third from 2010.</p>              <p>  China, however, has shown no signs of slowing. Deal volume in the country has already passed the $100 billion mark this year, up 15 percent from the same period in 2010. The transactions represent a range of industries, including industrials, finance, technology and retail.</p>              <p>  Deal activity also has soared in Indonesia. But with a less developed and robust economy, the acquisitions have been focused on mining, reflecting the country's rich resources.

The dynamic is different from other strong deal-making markets in Latin America, where foreign buyers account for much of the activity. Nondomestic companies represent more than 80 percent of the acquirers in Argentina and Peru. In Brazil, it's a roughly 50-50 split.; CASE IN POINT TURKEY: The fast-growing economy is undergoing a housing boom, a trend reflected in the equity markets. Over the last year, the five largest public offerings in the country have been for companies operating in the real estate sector; the Emlak Konut Real Estate Investment Trust, which builds commercial and residential complexes in Turkey, raised $791 million in December.; CASE IN POINT CHINA: Local investment banks and joint ventures with domestic players account for half of the 10 top deal-makers in the country, which has been the most active place for mergers and acquisitions among emerging and frontier markets this year. In one of the country's biggest deals, Nestle moved to buy a majority stake in the candy maker Hsu Fu Chi in July.; CASE IN POINT UGANDA: In March, the Chinese oil giant Cnooc and Total of France agreed to pay $2.9 billion for a two-thirds stake in the country's Tullow Oil -- the largest deal in Uganda since 2000.

It was unclear if Alibaba has taken formal steps on an offer, and a spokesman declined further comment.</p>              <p>Talk of a deal quickly raised questions among lawyers and analysts over user privacy and other concerns. Alibaba has argued that the company is privately held with no government ownership and already has an extensive presence in the U.S. through its Alibaba.com Ltd. e-commerce platform. Also, U.S. companies also use Alibaba Group's Taobao.com platform to reach Chinese buyers.

They said that a takeover by Alibaba of the U.S. Internet company isn't likely to raise antitrust issues, given the size and amount of competition of the U.S. Internet sector.</p>              <p>""One potentially big question mark would be whether the proposed deal would be viewed as having national-security implications"" in the U.S., said Neil Torpey, chairman of the Hong Kong office at U.S. corporate law firm Paul Hastings LLP.</p>              <p>""While it isn't obvious that Yahoo's business is critical to U.S. national interests, some parties may not want to see such a heavily used U.S.-based Web site acquired by a non-U.S. party, and others might raise a [Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S.] issue purely for political purposes.

The bidders didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>              <p>U.S.-based Chesapeake Energy Corp. is a shareholder in FTS -- which is known as Frac Tech -- and has said it wants to sell its stake.</p>              <p>For Sinopec Group, as China Petrochemical is known, the bid is part of a multitiered expansion effort into natural gas. The company's China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corp. unit and ENN Energy Holdings Ltd. on Tuesday offered up to $2.15 billion to acquire China Gas Holdings Ltd. China Gas, which has an extensive gas-distribution network in China, said late Wednesday that the bid ""fails to reflect its fundamental value."" Sinopec is likely to press on regardless, people close to the offer said.</p>              <p>China long has relied on its abundant supplies of coal to fuel its fast-growing economy. But the country is ramping up imports of cleaner-burning gas.</p>              <p>Beijing also hopes to exploit China's own natural-gas reserves. Among them, shale-gas deposits can be extracted by breaking the underground rock and pushing water and chemicals through the cracks to release hydrocarbons, a process called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.</p>              <p>China's technically recoverable shale-gas reserves are almost 50% greater than those of the U.S., according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But China's commercial production has been stymied by harsh terrain and insufficient technological prowess. Regulatory uncertainty also poses a roadblock; China has yet to outline terms for production-sharing contracts between foreign and state-owned companies.</p>              <p>Chinese companies have scoured the globe for energy, often ending up in remote and politically marginalized areas shunned by big Western oil companies, most notably in Sudan. Access to fracking technology, such as the equipment made and operated by Frac Tech, would be a major step toward tapping resources in China and elsewhere.</p>              <p>Frac Tech is close to agreeing to joint ventures with Sinopec in China, Saudi Aramco in the Mideast and Repsol YPF SA in Argentina, according to the person familiar with the matter. The Fort Worth, Texas, company would take a 49% stake in each project, with the foreign partner taking the remainder.</p>              <p>A consortium led by Singapore state-owned investment firm Temasek Holdings Pty. Ltd. and including sovereign-wealth funds Korea Investment Corp., China Investment Corp. and the Abu Dhabi Investment Council owns 70% of Frac Tech. The rest is held by U.S. natural-gas producer Chesapeake Energy. The stake sale up for bid likely would involve Frac Tech issuing new shares and a partial stake sale by existing shareholders, the person familiar with the matter said.

But a largely unnoticed deal on its home turf is proving to be the toughest test yet for its global ambitions.</p>              <p>The US$2.15 billion proposed takeover of one of China's biggest natural-gas companies has run into staunch opposition from other shareholders -- including its former managing director, who was recently released from a Chinese prison -- and might be facing regulatory hurdles.</p>              <p>It is proving to be a test for Fu Chengyu, the chairman of Sinopec, formally known as China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corp. It also raises issues about whether a private Chinese company can resist the entreaties of a state-owned giant.</p>              <p>Sinopec teamed with ENN Energy Holdings Ltd. in December to bid for China Gas Holdings Ltd., which controls gas pipelines that serve more than six million customers in China. China Gas rejected the deal, saying that it ""failed to reflect fundamental value.""</p>              <p>The bid came at a tough time for China Gas. A year earlier, Liu Minghui, China Gas's co-founder and managing director, was escorted from the company's headquarters in Shenzen by local authorities and spent close to a year in a Chinese prison on suspicion of embezzlement.</p>              <p>Mr. Liu is now out on bail and hasn't been charged in the case.</p>              <p>China Gas's shares, which are traded in Hong Kong, eventually fell nearly 50% amid the allegations against Mr. Liu. That created an opening for Sinopec to make a bid in which it would control 45% of 75% of China Gas, while its partner ENN, China's fourth-biggest natural-gas supplier in terms of revenue, would take 55%.</p>              <p>Three months later, the deal remains stalled in the face of opposition from shareholders and employees, 4,000 of whom sent letters rejecting state-owned Sinopec's overtures. In a note last week, UBS analysts said the offer, as it stands, ""won't proceed."" The Ministry of Commerce, which normally rules within two months on whether a deal would violate China's antimonopoly laws, has so far been silent.</p>              <p>For Sinopec's Mr. Fu, a ruling by regulators could be a signal about top Chinese leaders' views regarding his expansion project. Sinopec and Mr. Fu couldn't be reached to comment.</p>              <p>China Gas founder Mr. Liu is trying to stop the takeover by buying up shares in his former company. Joining Mr. Liu's efforts is London-listed energy company Fortune Oil PLC, which has been purchasing China Gas stock since the deal was proposed publicly and now owns 14% of the company with Mr. Liu, up from 10.3% soon after the offer was announced.</p>              <p>Another big recent buyer is South Korea's SK Group, a longtime shareholder, a conglomerate whose stake has risen to 15.3% from 10% at the time the bid was disclosed. Their buying has helped push China Gas's share price to 3.88 Hong Kong dollars (50 U.S. cents), above the HK$3.50 price offered by Sinopec and ENN.</p>              <p>A deal would need the approval of more than 50% of China Gas's shareholders.</p>              <p>Fortune Oil and Mr. Liu have said they would vote against the deal.</p>              <p>SK Group, which is collaborating on several projects with Sinopec, says its recent purchases have been strategic.</p>              <p>There is another political element to the China Gas deal. Three months after Mr. Liu was taken to prison, the company's board ousted two of its politically well-connected members, Chairman Li Xiao Yun and Vice Chairman Xu Ying.</p>              <p>The board said the two knew more about the arrest of Mr. Liu than they had shared with the board.

They are used to make petrochemicals and to dilute heavy crude oil for transport through pipelines.</p>              <p>The move is the latest pivot by Encana to manage low natural-gas prices resulting from a North American glut. When gas prices were high, it and many other energy firms shifted their gas exploration and development efforts into high gear.</p>              <p>Encana went further than most. In 2009, it spun off its heavy-oil division into a separate company, Cenovus Energy Inc., as gas prices began a short-lived recovery to near $6 per thousand cubic feet, only to fall again to $2.15 currently as unconventional drilling created a glut.</p>              <p>Since the start of 2010, Encana's stock has declined 42%, while Cenovus shares have risen 37%.</p>              <p>In 2010, Encana said it would double natural-gas production. Executives at the time said they would be able to produce at a low-enough cost to outlast smaller competitors that would be forced to decrease production. Encana and other large natural-gas producers, like Chesapeake Energy Corp. and ConocoPhillips, have all since begun to curtail natural gas.</p>              <p>Encana produced 3.3 billion cubic feet of gas a day last year but said well shutdowns and lower investment in dry gas will reduce 2012 production by some 500 million cubic feet a day.</p>              <p>Encana abandoned its heavy natural-gas strategy last year and sold off $1.6 billion of assets including gas-processing plants and fields.</p>              <p>Encana's futures-hedging strategy has protected it somewhat from the effect of low gas prices for the last few years. But most of those hedges will expire at the end of the year.</p>              <p>Hedges will allow Encana to sell two-thirds of its production at $5.80 per thousand cubic feet this year, more than twice current prices. But it has only a sixth of its production hedged for 2013. The company said in February that cuts to natural-gas production and asset sales will help it conserve cash to prepare for the end of those hedges.</p>              <p>Still, Encana's biggest investor believes its bet on gas will pay off.

Senior administration officials remained non-committal in the face of pressure from House Foreign Affairs Committee members during a Dec. 1 hearing that they pursue Chinese banks and companies under U.S. sanction laws for providing Iran with refined petroleum products or investing in its energy sector.
</p>
              <p>
When pressed by the committee's chairman and ranking member, State Department Under Secretary for Political Affairs William Burns responded that President Obama, in his most recent meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao, emphasized ""the importance we attach to restraint on the part of China in its dealings in the Iranian energy sector.""
</p>
              <p>
Although Burns would not say if Chinese companies were being investigated for sanctions violations, he said public sources show a slowdown in Chinese activities in the Iranian energy sector and that ""it may be that the Chinese are concluding that the Iranians, as so many other countries around the world have found, are not reliable energy partners.""
</p>
              <p>
Burns said that evidence of a decrease in Chinese refined petroleum exports to Iran can be found in rising domestic demand in China.
</p>
              <p>
Rep. Howard Berman (D-CA), who chairs the committee, said at the hearing he was convinced that Chinese companies are still engaging in activities that can be sanctioned under the law.
</p>
              <p>
Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) said the U.S. has known about Chinese energy investments in Iran for years, ""but only this past September did the administration initiate investigations of sanctionable activity."" She said the State Department ""still refuses to publicly disclose whether Chinese companies are among the targets.""
</p>
              <p>
Ros-Lehtinen was referring to the fact that the State Department on Sept. 30 sanctioned the first company since the Iran Sanctions Act was enacted in 1996. Ros-Lehtinen and other members of Congress criticized State for going after an ""easy target"" because that company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the National Iranian Oil Company.
</p>
              <p>
Burns defended the overall sanctions strategy as having a deep impact on the Iran, estimating that the new U.S. sanction strategy is causing Iran to lose anywhere between $50 billion and $60 billion in potential energy investment and that Iranian refined petroleum imports have decreased by 85 percent.
</p>
              <p>
The 1996 Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) was expanded this year by the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act (CISADA).
</p>
              <p>
CISADA imposes sanctions on any person who provides support for oil refinery projects or any other petroleum infrastructure projects in Iran or any person or company that does business in Iran with such an entity on or after July 1. The law also restricts certain designated entities from accessing the U.S. financial system.
</p>
              <p>
CISADA also allows the president to impose sanctions if during a 12-month period a company sells to Iran a shipment of refined petroleum products that has a value of $1 million or more or a number of shipments that have a value of $5 million or more. The goal of economic sanctions is to squeeze Iran enough to compel it to abandon its nuclear weapons program.
</p>
              <p>
Iran is expected to join ""P5 plus 1"" nuclear talks starting Dec. 6 in Geneva, where the U.S. along with China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom and Germany are expected to pressure Iran to abandon its uranium enrichment program, which the U.S. and its allies say is aimed at producing nuclear weapons.
</p>
              <p>
""This meeting takes place against a backdrop of the toughest economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure the Iranian government has faced,"" Burns said.
</p>
              <p>
China has urged the U.S. to step back from its sanctions policies, instead seeking a system of economic incentives to entice Iran to more meaningful dialogue, according to classified diplomatic communications leaked by Wikileaks.
</p>
              <p>
According to one communication from March 2008, a senior Chinese official told the U.S. that Iran-China energy cooperation has nothing to do with the Iran nuclear program, and that the official could not imagine at the time the consequences of U.S. sanctions against Sinopec, a major Chinese petroleum company.
</p>
              <p>
The documents leaked through Wikileaks came up in the context of the hearing when Berman asked Burns if he could comment on the report that Iran had acquired 19 medium-range missiles from North Korea. Burns condemned the breach of information but would not comment on the missile issue.
</p>
              <p>
Stuart Levey, Treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said sanctions are being felt by Iran ""as never before.""
</p>
              <p>
The U.S. has so far designated 17 Iran-related banks in connection with the Iran's proliferation activities, Levey said at the hearing.
</p>
              <p>
Since June, the U.S. has also designated 10 individuals and entities affiliated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) facilitating Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile program as well as 53 entities and nine individuals linked to the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL), which is accused of providing logistical and shipping support for Iran's weapons programs, Levey said.
</p>
              <p>
On Nov. 30, Treasury announced that it was designating 10 companies and five individuals affiliated with IRISL or Bank Mellat, which are both designated by Treasury as supporting Iran's weapons program. A U.S. person or entity is prohibited from doing business with these companies, and individuals and any assets of these companies and individuals under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen.
</p>

The Senate on March 11 named formal conferees to reconcile differences with the House on rival Iran sanctions bills targeting foreign firms that supply Iran with refined petroleum.
</p>
              <p>
Sens. Chris Dodd (D-CT), John Kerry (D-MA), Joe Lieberman (I-CT), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Richard Shelby (R-AL), Robert Bennett (R-UT) and Richard Lugar (R-IA) were named to the House-Senate conference.
</p>
              <p>
A House source said that the timing of the announcement of House conferees is still being discussed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard Berman (D-CA).
</p>
              <p>
The move comes as pressure mounts on Congress and the administration to toughen sanctions on Iran ahead of the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) slated for March 21 and in light of drawn-out talks aimed at obtaining United Nations sanctions over Iran's nuclear enrichment program.
</p>
              <p>
The Senate passed the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions and Accountability and Divestment Act (S. 2799) on Jan. 28 after the House passed the Iran Petroleum Sanctions Act (H.R. 2194), which would penalize foreign firms that supply Iran with refined petroleum or enhance its refining capacity, in December. The House in October also passed the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act (H.R. 1327), which focuses on encouraging divestment by U.S. states from Iran.
</p>
              <p>
The Senate sanctions bill combines provisions similar to both House bills and adds additional provisions, such as one targeting countries transshipping dual-use goods to Iran with possibly more stringent export control licenses.
</p>
              <p>
Since January, members of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations and Senate Banking committees have been working with the administration on expanded waivers that would allow the administration to avoid naming and sanctioning firms locating in allied countries. Informed sources said that the decision to hold a formal conference, a rarity for a foreign affairs bill, appeared related to a drive to wrap up the back-and-forth discussions.
</p>
              <p>
This week, Reps. Ron Klein (D-FL) and Mark Kirk (R-IL) introduced new legislation aimed at forcing the administration to complete investigations of possible violations of the existing Iran Sanctions Act (ISA), which applies sanctions to foreign firms investing more than $20 million in Iran's energy sector in one year.
</p>
              <p>
Klein and Kirk introduced the bill after the State Department revealed in a February letter that it has found potential violations of the ISA but did not reveal when it may complete its investigations. Since 1996, only one firm, France's Total, has been identified as violating the extra-territorial sanctions, and President Bill Clinton waived any penalties in that case.
</p>
              <p>
The Klein-Kirk bill contains a provision that requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to report on violators every thirty days.
</p>
              <p>
A House aide explained that the bill defines the GAO reports as ""credible evidence"" that therefore would trigger a presidential investigation and a report to Congress under the terms of the ISA.
</p>
              <p>
""Basically, before, the Administration was free to look for violations (or not) as they saw fit. This bill sets up a structure where they are handed a list of violations every month and are required to act promptly,"" the aide said.
</p>
              <p>
The provisions are similar to some in the Senate and House Iran petroleum sanctions bills. The Senate bill requires the president to tell the congressional committees of jurisdiction after 180 days its findings in a report that may contain a classified annex. The House bill has a similar requirement after 90 days. Supporters of tougher sanctions say the Klein-Kirk language would be stronger since the GAO report would be public and would put pressure on the administration to name violators.
</p>
              <p>
On Feb. 1, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Verma wrote to Klein in response to an Oct. 20 letter Klein wrote on the issue. He said that State has found some potential violations of the Iran Sanctions Act and it is continuing to investigate.
</p>
              <p>
""We have preliminarily reviewed this list and we believe that a number appear potentially problematic and warrant more thorough consideration,"" Verma wrote. In reply, Klein, Kirk and 28 other House members wrote to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Feb. 18 asking State to disclose the names of the companies under investigation and urging her to sanction violators of U.S. law.
</p>
              <p>
According to a 2008 Congressional Research Service report, 16 major foreign firms have invested more than $20 million in Iran's energy sector between 1999 and 2008. They include: Total, Royal Dutch Shell, Norsk Hydro, ENI, Sheer Energy of Canada, LG, Statoil, Inpex of Japan, Petrobras of Brazil, China's Sinopec and Malaysia's SK Ventures.
</p>
              <p>
This week AIPAC sent letters to all members of Congress demanding tougher actions on Iran sanctions. The letter came in the wake of a New York Times investigation that pointed out U.S. government contracts awarded to firms doing business with Iran including some which appear to be violating the ISA.
</p>
              <p>
AIPAC called on Congress to investigate why successive administrations have failed to implement the ISA, to enact the Iran petroleum sanctions legislation, and to demand that the administration ""enforce existing sanctions law and impose crippling new sanctions on Iran.""
</p>
              <p>
Related to Iran sanctions, the Office of Foreign Assets Control at Treasury on March 8 formally lifted export restrictions on the provision of Internet services and the free downloads of software needed for such services to Iran, Sudan and Cuba. Although social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, and chat applications provided by Microsoft have been crucial in helping dissidents in those countries communicate, until now U.S. firms had been reluctant to offer these services because they violated U.S. sanctions legislation in doing so.
</p>
              <p>
A new section 538.533 of the Sudanese Sanctions Regulations, part 515 of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, and 560.540 of the Iran Transactions Regulations outline the new general license available and specify that knowingly exporting these products to the governments of Iran and Sudan is not covered by the license.

U.S. Groups Look To Procurement Rules For Signs Of China Policy Shift
</p>
              <p>
U.S. business groups are looking toward the final implementing rules and administrative measures for China's government procurement law -- expected to be issued by year's end -- for a signal of the direction the country's new leadership is prepared to steer the Chinese economy when it takes over next spring.
</p>
              <p>
Groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Chamber of Commerce in China and the U.S.-China Business Council have provided extensive comments to China's Ministry of Finance since it issued draft implementing rules in January 2010, followed shortly thereafter by measures that laid out how domestic products would be defined in administering the rules.
</p>
              <p>
Those draft administrative measures included a number of measures that openly favored the procurement of domestic goods and services over imports, and also featured domestic content requirements for qualifying for preferences that went beyond international norms.
</p>
              <p>
The degree to which the Ministry of Finance and other Chinese agencies involved in revising the draft implementing rules and accompanying draft measures manage to make them less discriminatory and more in line with international standards, as recommended by U.S. and other foreign business interests, will be a ""timely indicator"" of whether more market-friendly policies may be in store during the expected upcoming government of current Vice President Xi Jinping, said one U.S. business source.

China Energy Investment In U.S. Features Smaller Deals, More Modest Goals
</p>
              <p>
Chinese energy-related investment into the United States and Canada has grown rapidly in the past two years and is poised for further expansion, but in pursuit of a different set of objectives than those that drove the failed 2005 takeover effort by Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) of California's Unocal, according to investment and energy experts participating on a panel at the Woodrow Wilson Center.
</p>
              <p>
The CNOOC attempt at a $18.5 billion takeover of Unocal, which failed due to congressional opposition and national security concerns examined by the Committee on Foreign Direct Investment in the United States (CFIUS), was worth more than all Chinese investment into the U.S. over the 2003-2011 period and sought complete ownership control, said Adam Lysenko, a research analyst at the Rhodium Group.
</p>
              <p>
But after a cooling off period, Chinese energy firms have now shifted their investment strategy in recent years toward deals that are ""less threatening and less intimidating"" because of their smaller size and more limited objectives, Lysenko said during a May 31 discussion on Chinese investment in North American energy.
</p>
              <p>
For instance, subsequent CNOOC investments in U.S. firm Chesapeake Energy of $2 billion in 2010 and $1.32 billion in 2011 both sought only 33.33 percent ownership stakes, as did China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (Sinopec) in its 2012 $2.4 billion investment in U.S. firm Devon Energy.

Democratic Lawmakers Seek To Condition U.S. OK Of China Energy Bid
</p>
              <p>
Two leading Democratic lawmakers are urging the Obama administration to withhold approval of China National Offshore Oil Corporation's (CNOOC) $15.1 billion bid to purchase Canadian energy firm Nexen Inc. until China improves its treatment of U.S. investment in China and the Chinese state energy giant agrees to pay royalties on Nexen-owned oil and gas operations off the U.S. Gulf Coast.
</p>
              <p>
Because of Nexen's operations off the U.S. Gulf Coast, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is expected to have a role in vetting CNOOC's bid for the Canadian firm based on U.S. national security criteria. CFIUS is chaired by the Treasury Department.
</p>
              <p>
Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) in a July 27 letter urged Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to use the leverage created by the Chinese investment bid made last week to insist on ""tangible, enforceable commitments to ensure U.S. companies reciprocal treatment"" when they seek to invest in China.
</p>
              <p>
In his letter, Schumer said that the ""degree"" of market access for U.S. firms that want to invest in China is ""[o]ne of the primary areas relevant to"" the proposed CNOOC-Nexen deal.
</p>
              <p>
On July 30, Rep. Edward Markey (D-MA), the ranking Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, asked Geithner to use the pending deal as leverage for extracting royalty payments from Nexen. He said the company has not paid royalties on 32 million barrels of oil and 34 million cubic feet of natural gas that it has taken out of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico through May of this year.

White House Said To Prefer Model BIT SOE Provisions For China Treaty
</p>
              <p>
The White House has shown skepticism about trying to use the same language it is advocating for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with respect to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) as the basis for negotiating disciplines for SOEs in a bilateral investment treaty with China, according to an informed source.
</p>
              <p>
A White House economic adviser conveyed this skeptical attitude toward TPP-like language in a closed-door meeting with business representatives last month. The adviser's message ""seemed to be an indication it was just the model BIT the White House was using for China,"" according to the source.
</p>
              <p>
The newly revised U.S. model BIT contains some updated language disciplining SOEs but is not as detailed or prescriptive as the SOE language the U.S. is negotiating with other Asia-Pacific trading partners in ongoing TPP talks.
</p>
              <p>
The meeting took place after business groups sought clarification of comments made by Undersecretary of State for Economic, Energy and Agricultural Affairs Robert Hormats at the conclusion of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&amp;ED) last May in Beijing. Hormats at the time suggested the administration was prepared to re-engage with China in BIT negotiations based solely on the SOE language in the model BIT.

A joint economic study released last week by the governments of China and Canada represents a first step toward the initiation of exploratory talks on a free trade agreement or other deals aimed at deepening bilateral economic ties, according to private-sector observers.
</p>
              <p>
These observers agreed that the announcement of the exploratory talks is forthcoming now that the study is completed, although it is unclear exactly when that will occur. The study concluded that ""the Canadian and Chinese governments should continue to deepen and strengthen our bilateral trade and investment ties through appropriate bilateral instruments,"" but gave no specifics as to the timeline for beginning the exploratory talks.
</p>
              <p>
Jason Myers, president of Canadian Manufacturers &amp; Exporters, said in an interview that leaders of both countries could announce a launch of the exploratory talks at next month's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Russia. This is consistent with the wide expectation that the announcement would need to come at the leaders' level.
</p>
              <p>
But another Canadian business source questioned whether the two leaders will go ahead with that announcement given the controversy that has emerged over Chinese state-owned oil firm CNOOC's planned acquisition of Canadian oil company Nexen, announced last month.
</p>
              <p>
The Canadian government must review that transaction under the Investment Canada Act and can block the deal if it does not present a ""net benefit"" to Canada, this source said. Announcing a plan to further deepen bilateral economic ties while this transaction is under review could complicate matters and send ""conflicting signals"" to the market, according to this source.
</p>
              <p>
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Chinese President Hu Jintao in February agreed to conclude the joint economic study by May, after which the two sides would proceed to exploratory discussions on deepening trade and economic relations.

            >
            
              <p>
The Obama administration's effort to convince China to subject its state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to the disciplines of the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) is facing challenges due to China's complex regime of procurement laws and regulations, jurisdictional fights within the Chinese government, and the reality of how SOEs come into being and operate in China, according to government procurement experts.
</p>
              <p>
Obama administration officials are pushing China to include SOEs in its revised offer to join the GPA, which China has said it will table before a Dec. 5 meeting in Geneva with other GPA members. But partly due to the unique challenges in China on the issue of SOEs and procurement, it remains unclear what China could ultimately agree to on SOE coverage, including in its forthcoming offer.
</p>
              <p>
""I'm not quite sure when and whether China will offer the procurement of state-owned enterprises for coverage of the GPA,"" Ping Wang, an expert on Chinese procurement law at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom, said in an interview. He said it may be more realistic to expect China's next offer to include greater coverage of sub-central entities, which China included for the first time in its last offer, tabled in November 2011.
</p>
              <p>
One fact that is complicating matters is that China has two laws covering procurement, neither of which conform to the non-discrimination and procedural requirements of the GPA. The first is known as the 2003 Government Procurement Law, which falls under the jurisdiction of China's Ministry of Finance (MOF) and applies to government agencies and other state organs but does not apply to SOEs.
</p>
              <p>
The second is the 2000 Tendering Law, which is under the jurisdiction of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and covers certain procurements by SOEs.
</p>
              <p>
The U.S. and other GPA partners have long urged China to amend both laws so that they comply with GPA rules, but China argues its accession should focus on the Government Procurement Law, which covers everything it believes to constitute ""government procurement,"" one expert said. China maintains that GPA disciplines are not relevant for SOEs because, in its view, SOEs are commercial companies and not part of the government, sources said.
</p>
              <p>
There are also political reasons why the bifurcated legal system in China is complicating the GPA accession negotiations. In particular, MOF is heading up the negotiations for China's GPA accession even though the Tendering Law falls outside of its jurisdiction and is overseen by NDRC.
</p>
              <p>
Wang stressed that MOF and NDRC are separate entities with their own power structures and interests, and that there has been little coordination between the two in context of the ongoing GPA negotiations.
</p>
              <p>
In fact, one reason he questioned whether China will provide anything on SOEs in its forthcoming offer is because there are no indications that MOF has engaged in detailed talks with NDRC and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC). Such talks would be necessary to allow China to prepare an offer that covered SOEs, he maintained.
</p>
              <p>
Developing an offer that includes SOEs would likely require much greater internal coordination between these and other Chinese government entities, as well as greater coordination with the major SOEs themselves, something Wang said could greatly prolong the accession negotiations. The U.S. and other GPA parties therefore need to ""weigh the benefits"" of continuing to press on this issue versus the value of wrapping up the talks in the nearer term, he argued.
</p>
              <p>
The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) last month sponsored a trip by Chinese officials to the U.S. to learn more about how U.S. SOEs conduct procurement in accordance with the GPA, in hopes that this could illustrate to China that it is feasible for its SOEs to do the same, according to a USTDA official.
</p>
              <p>
Even if the U.S. and other GPA parties were able to convince China to offer up some SOE coverage, the extent to which this would ultimately benefit U.S. companies remains somewhat unclear, and would depend greatly on the specifics of the deal. This is because of the way in which Chinese SOEs operate on the ground in China, Wang said.
</p>
              <p>
If China were to eventually agree to subject some of its existing SOEs to GPA disciplines, that could still leave major new SOEs created in the future uncovered. That is especially relevant in China, where the government often establishes new SOEs to oversee major new infrastructure projects, as was the case with the Beijing-Shanghai high speed rail project and the Three Gorges Dam project, Wang noted.
</p>
              <p>
One way to address this potential problem, he said, would be for GPA parties to focus not on coverage of specific SOEs but rather on ensuring that China grants foreign suppliers access to public infrastructure projects.
</p>
              <p>
That could be done through the list of covered construction services sectors in Annex 6 of China's proposed GPA schedule, he said. China could commit to open certain sectors under this annex to foreign competition, and then include a general note saying this commitment applies to all central government entities, sub-central entities and SOEs regardless of whether they are listed in the other annexes, he speculated.
</p>
              <p>
Another potential limitation is the fact that China is expected to accede to the revised GPA, which current GPA parties finished negotiating last December. Article II.2(a)(ii) of the revised text exempts from GPA coverage goods and services that are procured with a view for commercial resale or with a view to use in the production of goods or the provision of services for commercial resale.
</p>
              <p>
Wang pointed out that a broad interpretation of this exclusion could leave the majority of Chinese SOE procurement outside of the GPA's scope. China could argue that nearly everything bought by an SOE -- including raw materials, computers for administration, and construction services to build a new facilities -- is used to produce goods or provide services for commercial resale by the SOE.
</p>
              <p>
He also cited several other factors that could make it harder for GPA parties to take advantage of coverage of Chinese SOEs, including the issue of enforcement. In particular, Wang noted that China agreed in the context of its World Trade Organization accession agreement to ensure that its SOEs operated solely on the basis of commercial considerations, but this commitment has done little to change the purchasing behavior of Chinese SOEs.
</p>
              <p>
Concerning the two procurement laws in China, Wang argued that one ""rational"" option would be for GPA negotiators to convince China to merge them and ensure the consolidated law complies with GPA disciplines.
</p>
              <p>
But he acknowledged this is unlikely to happen anytime soon because MOF and NDRC do not want to give up their respective jurisdictions over the individual laws. He also noted that there is no strong push from the leadership of the Communist Party on this issue, which would be necessary to overcome this jurisdictional dispute.
</p>
              <p>
Dan Gordon, associate dean for government procurement law at George Washington University, said in an interview that GPA parties should not take a prescriptive approach of telling China how to structure its government procurement regime, such as merging the two laws into one.
</p>
              <p>
He noted that the U.S. itself has a complex procurement system that includes federal entities, sub-federal entities and SOEs such as the Tennessee Valley Authority. Gordon argued that the U.S. would not be keen to restructure that system merely due to pressure from trading partners, and that the U.S. should therefore not expect China to do so. ""These issues are best left aside,"" he said.
</p>
              <p>
Gordon, who served as a top federal procurement official under President Obama and has participated in public procurement seminars in China, said GPA parties should instead focus on two major areas in the negotiations. The first is to push for broad coverage of Chinese procurement, including SOEs -- regardless of how that is achieved -- and the second is to ensure that China's brings its procurement laws into compliance with the procedural and transparency standards of the GPA.
</p>
              <p>
The 2000 Tendering Law does not apply specifically to SOEs, but rather to any company -- public or private -- that conducts procurement for construction projects that are related to the public interest, financed with state funds, or funded through international aid, according to a forthcoming article by Wang in Frontiers of Law in China, an academic journal.
</p>
              <p>
This means that some SOE procurement is ""de facto"" covered under the Tendering Law even though SOEs are not explicitly singled out in it, Wang writes in the article. He also highlights that, in addition to the Tendering Law, there are a number of other ministerial regulations that impose rules on SOE procurement as well as specific regulations adopted by individual SOEs, such as state oil company Sinopec.
</p>
              <p>
In the interview, Wang said the Government Procurement Law and the Tendering Law are generally in compliance with the procedural and transparency requirements of the GPA, although a few minor changes may be needed. But neither of the laws is in compliance with the GPA's requirement that procuring entities not discriminate against foreign suppliers, he said.
</p>
              <p>
In particular, the Government Procurement Law contains ""Buy Chinese"" requirements that discriminate against foreign suppliers. The Tendering Law does not contain an obligation either to discriminate or not to discriminate, but that opens the door for SOEs covered under it to create their own discriminatory policies if they so choose, Wang added.

Canada Approves CNOOC, But Outlines Guidelines For Future SOE Deals
</p>
              <p>
Earlier this month, the Canadian government gave the green light to proposed investments by Chinese and Malaysian state-owned oil firms to invest in Canadian energy companies. At the same time, however, it announced several new policies that will subject investments by foreign state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to a higher level of scrutiny in government foreign-investment reviews, and could limit SOE takeovers in its oil and gas sector moving forward.

Canadian Ministry of Industry Christian Paradis on Dec. 7 announced that he had approved applications by China's National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) to acquire Nexen and by Malaysia's Petronas to acquire Progress Energy Resources after finding these transactions were likely to result in a ""net benefit"" for Canada, which is the threshold for approval under the Investment Canada Act.

              <p>
That same day, however, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that the government was tightening the criteria under which future proposed investments by SOEs would be deemed to be in the net benefit of the country, especially in the area of oil sands development. Nexen and Progress Energy are both energy companies that are involved in developing Canada's oil sands, among other activities.

              <p>
In particular, Harper said the Canadian government had determined that foreign state control of oil sands development had reached the point where further such investments by foreign SOEs would not be of net benefit to Canada. Therefore, the Canadian government in the future will only approve acquisitions resulting in control of a Canadian oil-sands business by a foreign SOE ""in an exceptional circumstance,"" Harper said.

U.S. Companies See Threat In Explosion Of Utility Model Patents In China
</p>
              <p>
U.S. companies say that China's drive to encourage more innovation among its domestic companies has led to a proliferation of so-called utility model patents (UMPs), which could pose a problem to U.S. companies doing business there for two reasons.
</p>
              <p>
UMPs are much easier to obtain than true ""invention"" patents, in part because Chinese authorities do not really examine UMP patent applications with much vigor and because the actual standard for review on issues like the ""inventiveness"" of a invention is lower, according to a new report released by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
</p>
              <p>
Despite the relative ease with which they are granted, however, UMPs remain difficult to invalidate. Their number has dramatically escalated in China in recent years due to mandates from the Chinese government to increase patent filings as a measure that innovation is taking off in China.
</p>
              <p>
This rapid proliferation has two main problems, according to the report, which was released on Nov. 30. First, ""patent trolls"" could increasingly buy up these UMPs and then allege that innovative companies infringe on them in the hope that the innovative companies will forgo litigation and agree to settle the matter through a payment.
</p>
              <p>
Settlement of such allegations can be attractive because invalidation proceedings can cost upward of $30,000 and may take one or two years, according to the report which was written by Thomas Moga, a partner at Schook, Hardy &amp; Bacon LLP. While most companies in China have not yet been targeted by ""patent trolls,"" the report argues that it is ""just a matter of time"" before this occurs.
</p>
              <p>
""All respondents [interviewed for the report] said that there will be a significant increase in troll activity,"" it notes.
